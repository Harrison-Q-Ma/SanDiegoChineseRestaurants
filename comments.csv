Green China Grill,"This is the only noodle restaurant I go to in San Diego. They have the best noodles, they literally handpull it in front of you're eyes like no joke. It's pretty cool to watch: From a piece of dough to thin noodles. You can also choose your noodle sizes too. I could neva lol. I love the noodle soups along with some lamb skewers and the SNOW BEEF skewers and the chicken skewers are a MUST TRY. Also, I love the fact that they have some side dishes such as mini hot pot. They have it from beef to seafood, they even have the vegetarian options. Bringing my friends back this week. Sadly they don't open on Tuesdays. Parking is a little hard here. Also you get a 10% discount is you're paying cash. Services is amazing, super friendly staff and clean environments. Good vibes overall."
Green China Grill,"Definitely some of the best noodles I've had in San Diego by far and they offer quite the range of Chinese noodle preparations and other side-offerings (soups, hotpots, skewers, etc.).  Their main shindig would be their freshly made noodles though, which you have a pretty neat opening into the kitchen so you can see BOH making them.  Great for casual dining.  Note their cash discount (10%).  Parking on Convoy is always a bit dicey, but we got lucky in the Plaza right outside.  Generally service was good, though food took a bit to reach us (slightly over 20min) by virtue of the lunch rush.  QR code opens up their digital menu, but ordering placed with waitstaff face to face.They have a range of six noodle thicknesses (pictured) that give you options changing their thicknesses and profile (flat/thin).  You also have the option for hand-pulled or knife cut / sliced.  Bit of choice paralysis, but we ended up going for their braised beef noodle soup (sliced, default size) and cumin lamb fried noodles (flat noodles).==Beef Noodle soup==  Bowl of soul soothing goodness.  Simple and hearty, yet delicious.  Broth by itself was fairly light on seasoning, but adjusted to a great spot with spicy sauce on the side.  Came with some fresh cilantro and radishes.  The beef was pretty potent on flavor.  But the noodles?  Oh, they were perfect: great chew and heft, chunky sizes going from thick to thin (from the knife cut).  Couldn't ask for more.==Lamb Fried Noodles==  These tasted pretty good; lamb flavor throughout everything, the thick noodle texture was really on point.  Bit on the greasier side for fried noodles, but not an unexpected amount.  Unfortunately, a sour point was that we only got three (3) small-medium sized pieces of lamb in the whole thing (pictured is the only med piece we had).  Given the price markup this feels like we got shortchanged (+$4 for lamb).  I let it slide given the price of meats lately and we were visiting, but more local folks that come more often should pay some heed."
Green China Grill,thank you Kevin
Green China Grill,"BIG fans of Green China Grill. We flip back and forth between Din Tai Fung and Green China Grill a few times a month.Our favorite dishes at Green China Grill are the choice of three cold dishes (we usually go with the mushrooms, tofu noodles, and cucumber), and (of course) the hand-pulled noodles. We always get the wide ones with the spicy hot oil. Also, we recently discovered the cucumber and sesame paste noodles and they are AMAZING.We don't eat animals (ok, the occasional poke bowl or sushi or oyster), so this is perfect for us.Oh, and great service too."
Green China Grill,"ANYONE who rates Green China Grill lower than 4 stars either doesn't know good food, or has a major chip on their shoulder and wants to show off to their friends. When it comes to Chinese, hand-pulled noodles, this place definitely rates 5 stars. Period.In our continuing Convoy quest, my wife and I stopped by Green China Grill last night. We ordered the spicy biang biang noodles, spicy lamb skewers, beef pancake, and a couple beers. The biang biang noodles were exceptionally good -- probably the best noodles I've ever had (and I've had MANY, all around the world). The lamb skewers and beef pancake were also very good.Definitely a place we'll be back to as we work our way up and down Convoy..."
Green China Grill,"Contemplating between 4 star or 5 stars.  I ordered #1 noodle and #2 noodle dish on 2 different occasions.I am happy with the noodles here first of all.There are choices on the size of the noodles.  Chose default one and thicker one.  Both good experience.  It has good texture.  Not too sure about the topping.  The beef on both of the serving was good, but I guess I am just used to ramen bowls with bunch of toppings.  But maybe that's comparing apples and bananas.  Perhaps not a good comparison, maybe this dish is served exactly the way it is supposed to be served.Now for the broth.  I thought initially it was bland.  But is it?  There is some sort of umami flavor there I cannot figure out.  And it keeps me sipping on the broth.  Not sure how they made it.  But it's actually has the depth in flavor I am looking for in a soup dish.  Granted I had to come here twice to come to this conclusion.  Lol. But good broth, so 5 stars."
Green China Grill,"A+ manager,  Chris! He was incredibly hospitable and thorough.  If i had a restaurant. I would want to hire him. Hand pulled noodles with shrimp were excellent.All of the appetizers,  cucumbers,  tofu skin, blanched potatoes and seaweed eye very refreshing. Only one star off because some of the dishes were spicy without any indication on the menu,  so my mom couldn't enjoy them. I recommend that they indicate on the menu :)Oh the fried bread slices were unique.  I liked them,  but my mom earned thrilled with the seasoning.Best thing was that they closed to let their staff eat between lunch and dinner time,  but didn't kick us out. They let us finish our meal in peace.  Awesome. Side note:This place has a sign up about being halal. I had to look it up. It's a Muslim practice when they slaughter their beef.  It's a particular way and is done with a specific prayer.  I wondered if they had non halal, regular options,  but it seems that they didn't.  So, good place for local muslims to eat according to their beliefs. Like kosher, which I think means certain foods are not permitted, Halal is also a way of beef preparation that includes a religious blessing.  Someone correct me if I am wrong."
Green China Grill,"Came back and this time had the tomato egg dish with default size noodles. Unfortunately a little too sweet for me. It was tasty otherwise. A huge of amount of noodles that I wish they gave a little bit more of the tomato egg for.That being said, service was still top notch and super friendly! Still highly recommend this place but stick with the soups."
Green China Grill,"Such delicious food in a really unassuming place. A cool part of this place is that you can see through a glass window and watch your noodles get freshly pulled/cooked. Also for the noodle dishes you can choose the thickness and cut of your noodles! Service was also really friendly and fast. I tried the braised beef noodle soup with thin noodles. The broth is so clear and really good flavor without being oily. The noodles had a nice chewiness to them too. My partner got the spinach sirloin noodle soup with extra thin noodles. We were surprised to see that the noodles actually had a green color to them! Probably from the spinach. But he said the spinach flavor didn't really come through. Between the sirloin and the braised beef, the sirloin ended up being a little more tender but the braised beef had a stronger flavor.I personally thought the prices were a little high but the quality of food was really good and with the friendly service I would definitely still recommend this place!"
Green China Grill,"When I got here at 1:30pm on a Sunday, I saw a line out the door. There was a waitlist and it took about 20 mins for me to be seated. The restaurant shouts authenticity. From the window featuring a hand-pulled noodles show to the customer base (mostly mainland Chinese), I knew I was getting good Chinese food. I ordered all the popular menu items per the suggestion of my excellent host (he has an extremely funny personality and he even gave us a side of cold appetizers because it was our first time!!) and everything was soo soo good! Since the noodles are pulled fresh to order, it did take a bit of time (15 mins?) for it to come out but it was totally worth the wait! Come here if you want to make your tummy happy!! :D"
Green China Grill,thank you sir !
Green China Grill,"I am surprised by the quality of the hand pulled noodles. It was fresh and oh so soft. We ordered the sirloin noodles (extra thin noodles), braised beef with extra thin noodles and 3 mix cold dishes. The braised beef was tender but it didn't melt in my mouth and the broth is flavorful. It's presented in a large bowl with an abundance of noodles. There's too many delicious items on the menu to select from, therefore, we are definitely going to come back here again to try other items on the menu."
Green China Grill,thank you Lyn
Green China Grill,"I don't like the fried noodle although it was highly recommended by the owner: too oily. The side dish is tasty but the portion is small, not really worthy the price paid. For the same price, I prefer to go their neighbor."
Green China Grill,"Came here for the first time with my family last night. This is the place to be if you want a chill place with some hand pulled noodles! All of the dishes we tried were amazing. Skewers - we for the lamb, chicken, and beef. They come on these metal skewers and taste amazing when they are hot! I really loved the lamb one, just because I love lamb and cumin, but if you're looking for something more flavorful and sweet- the chicken skewers are the ones to go to! They have a sweet bbq taste. Noodles- they were all amazing. The noodles were so good, we got an extra order of just the plain noodles. We tried the spicy hot oil noodles with the flat noodles (thick ones) and the flavor was definitely on point, but would have wished I ate it faster because it got cold quickly! We also tried the beef noodle soup with the thin flat noodles- my family loved this one! Just slurping up those hand pulled noodles! We also got the beef stew pot- the flavors in this one was amazing. The fat on the thinly sliced beef + the slight sour seasoning in the broth brought a lot of depth to this dish.Appetizer - the cold dish- must try the tripe!! It's so crunchy and the Mala seasoning it's marinated in is so numbing it's addicting! We also got wood ear which also had the Mala flavor and the cucumbers which were crunchy and refreshing.There are so many other menu items I want to try! I'll have to come back.Parking can be a little touch, so come early and be prepared to circle around."

Green China Grill,Thank u so much !!
Green China Grill,"This is the place I always go for hand pulled noodles. Always perfectly chewy noodles. Broth is also light and does not make me feel thirsty. Beef and sour cabbage pancake is crispy and juicy. Everything delicious overall. Plus, 10% off if you pay in cash"
Green China Grill,"thank you so much sweetie, come back anytime."
Green China Grill,"Came here for the first time with my family. Let me start off with the hostess/waiter he was the BEST!! Super nice and patient!! Couldn't ask for a better service!!They do have their own parking lot so you don't have to pay to park. They also have street parking if the parking lot is full. The noodles were so delicious. They make their own noodles in house so it is very fresh and tasty. Their meat is very tender, they slice it super thin so it is easy for you to eat. If you have not tried this place, please put this on your list as you will not be disappointed. Everything about this place was awesome. Thank you Green China Grill for a great first time experience, we will definitely be back."
Green China Grill,"I went to your restaurant more than once. So I have tried almost every single dish on your menu already. None of them taste good.  Also, you are the only restaurant in San Diego who charge customer for to go containers."
Green China Grill,"im so very sorry you didnt like the food. we do card as well, we do cash only, only if its under $20, as we informed you before ordering. you ordered 1 dish, we let you use card, and you added another dish, you're still paying card. sorry if there's any confusion, happy fathers day :) hopefully we will make it better next time. ps:  oh also, I believe you only ordered 2 dishes, the sirloin beef noodle soup (thick noodle) and sesame cold noodles. next time we will recommend you to try everything, im sure you will like at least one dish :) thanks again love.updated respond:so you come back more than once? you don't like any of the food but you keep coming back?  then put false information about us only accept cash, the saying we're rude. now you changed your review again.  girl what is it"
Green China Grill,"We came back here with our friends. This is a place that we always like and we wanna come back here again and again. Here's food is super authentic and just tastes like what you eat in real China. I also love they don't adjust the food taste to meet all other cultures peoples taste. It is authentic and nice. This time, we tried the hot chilly oil noodles, which is so yummy and hand pulled noodles are chewy and fresh. The service here is great, we really love the passion of the manager who is very helpful."
Green China Grill,"I feel like I'm back in China!!! To be honestly, this restaurant is the most authentic Chinese place I've ever had in San Diego. Even my husband said so too, and he has only been to China twice. It's very authentic and delicious!!! All the foods we ordered are very well made with good and clean ingredients, you can even watch they make the hand pulled noodles through the window. I love my cold cucumber and sesame rice noodles. My husband loved his lamb skewers. Both of us loved the beef wrap the most, it's so crispy outside. The cold dish is nice, you can pick 3 to make a combo. When my parent comes to visit, I'm sure they will love this place."
Green China Grill,"Good food. The noodles are amazing really. The big flat hand cut ones we almost two feet long. Wild. Two different  tofu were both fantastic. The tentacle looking tofu in the cold salad bar is a must try. Different than anything I have had at any Asian cuisine restaurant and delicious.The beef soup is real good. Different also. Broth seems like a tea base, mild in flavor, but the beef in it is really flavored and the fresh noodles in it as I said are amzing.. also the service was super. The gal was polite, helpful with recommendations and favorites, not in a rush like these places normally are, and she asked us twice as our food progressed how we were liking everything like she really wanted to know. And a manager, I assume he was, also came out pleasantly and asked how we like everything, like they do in a high end steak house. Pretty cool."
Green China Grill,the best beef noodle  in San Diego. I come here twice a week. That's should says all  also all the side dishes so good.
Green China Grill,"Very bad experience!  The food is expensive and tastes terrible.  Furthermore, I tipped them $5 on the receipt, while they actually charged me $7.5 for the tip, which I found after a few weeks.  Don't recommend this restaurant at all!"
Green China Grill,"good morning. our restaurant is known for good quality food, the flavor might not fit your taste, im so very sorry. but we always have a good reputation of having the best service, and we WILL NOT charge falsely for any customers. I'd like you to provide the date and receipts anytime to me, if we accidentally charged you extra I will give you a dispute back to the card, and refund you with a $200 apologize credit at our restaurant you can eat anytime. but please come over and show me the false charge? sounds good ? because I don't want other customers to see the false information that might not be true."
Green China Grill,"On a whim I tried the 'beef pancake' appetizer while I was waiting for an order from another restaurant and was delighted at how good it was. One of these appetizers is a meal by itself, tasty and filling. We'll definitely try some of their other dishes in the future."
Green China Grill,thank you so much.
Green China Grill,"Love this place.  One of the best hand made noodles in town.  They also have the best cold dishes in town.  One of the few Chinese restaurants I go to that I don't have a stomach ache the next day.  I can never come here without ordering at least one order or two orders of the cold dishes.  Their service is always pretty on point, menu is clear also have digital qr code menus.  I have nothing else to say but good things about this place.  Parking is a bit difficult to find when you come here on the weekend."
Green China Grill,"The food is on the sweet side, including fried rice. Prices are on the high side for the quality and quantity.Not a fan!"
Green China Grill,"Got veggie fried noodles through ubereats, thr food was packaged well and was tasty. The beggies werr vooked just right with enough noodles to satisfy me. Would consider going there in person."

Green China Grill,"Favorite Chinese restaurant in town!!! We've been here twice and both times I kept saying ""oh my god I can't believe how good it is!"" while eating - you know it's good when you can't shut up! We've tried cumin chicken noodle, braised beef noodle soup, lamb paomo, and some appetizers - all are AMAZING!!!"
Green China Grill,Thank you love !
Green China Grill,the noodle is very professional. We plan a trip to here for this restaurant from LA. hope they can open a branch in LA:).
Green China Grill,I appreciate you.
Green China Grill,Best service in town. Super friendly super pet friendly! The store manager Chris is such a wonderful staff to have. Sis and terry are amazing too! Food is very authentic and delicious. Highly recommend! 100% satisfied.
Green China Grill,thank you She. very much.

Green China Grill,"My new favorite restaurant.Look,  I don't want to be dramatic but I had the best noodle soup, (probably ever) here~ right here at good ol Green China. Don't think, just get the braised beef noodle soup with the hand sliced noodles~ Thank me laterThe spice, the broth, the braised beef~ flavors are so deliciously unique & complex . I'm so glad I decided to go against my initial judgement when my friend suggested this place~ I clearly knew nothing at the time."
Green China Grill,thank you Jen.
Green China Grill,Honestly super nice and caring workers. Was so pleasantly surprised. The environment was also clean and comfortable.
Green China Grill,"They added more items to the menu, but the go to is still the hand pulled noodle soup for me.  I personally like the braised beef noodle soup with added pickled vegetables the best.  The meat is a bit sweet and has a lot of flavor.  I also get the regular thin noodles.  The texture and size of the noodles can be customized to the way you want it.  I believe you can get knife cut noodle, thick noodle, regular noodle, or thin noodle.  And even for the noodle options, you can still customize it again, if you know the exact thickness that you like.  The cold dishes are a must get to as it compliments the noodles really well.  Be careful not too add too much hot oil.  Its spicier than it looks!"
Green China Grill,The sour cabbage and beef noodle soup was pretty good. I was expecting the beef to be more on the leaner side but was pleasantly surprised by how fatty it actually was. I would come back to try the knife cut noodles and the beef noodle soup
Green China Grill,Authentic and delicious. As soon as we walked in we were kindly greeted and seated. After figuring out it was our first time visiting our waiter went through the whole menu with plenty of recommendations. It was nice to try some local Chinese cuisine. Definitely coming back soon.
Green China Grill,"It's Christmas here already with a beautiful tree. Great place. Friendly staffs, and delicious noodle. If you want authentic Chinese hand pulled noodles, this is the place to be. Our server makes excellent recommendations, we ordered sour cabbage beef pancake, braised beef noodle soup, and cumin fried sliced noodle. Everything is Devine. The restaurant is very clean, too. Love the betta fish they have too, they told me he's name is little B. Haha Will be back for sure, and bring my family. Thank you green China grill."
Green China Grill,"This place is terrible. One of the first times we regretted getting supposedly authentic Chinese food. Check out the portion of the lamb ($10), the beef sour cabbage pancake was very bland ($13), and the Xinjiang spicy chicken noodles ($20) was not spicy at all! And contained mostly onions. I was craving my mom's Xinjiang spicy chicken dish, but this was nothing like it nor can compare to it. The flavor of the lamb was pretty good but not worth the price. The other two we'd rate as solid 1.5 and 2 out of 5. Also they charged 60 cents for each takeout container. With the price being so high, overall 1 star. The reviews which say 'I'm back in China' do not know what real Chinese food is, period."
Green China Grill,"hey Hannah, first of all thank you and your boyfriend Alex very much for both commenting on our page.  that's so thoughtful of you, I guess the food must be really bad to you guys. our restaurant is known as an authentic Chinese restaurant, we are full every day and our regular and new customer loves our food that's why we have the same style and same flavor food for the past 6 years. you're welcome back anytime to try our food again anytime, we will be here to serve you anytime. if not, spicy city is next to us, skip us and go there. our food is from different region of china, maybe there's no need to make our restaurant look so bad just because it doesn't fit your taste. and no needs to put down our customer who gave us good 5 stars review saying they've never been to china. she was actually Chinese from mainland china. again, I apologize to you that you don't like the food, you don't have to come back if its that bad for you to commenting bad about us everywhere. hope you sleep good at night honey."
Green China Grill,"food is good but the yellow hair server guy is terrible. Very arrogant and rude. Also didn't really following the health department guidance. He shouldn't touch his dog before handling the food to us. I thought Halal restaurant shouldn't allowing small animal get inside, and that guy touching, playing his dog while he is working. Just because of ask our food showed us his amgry face and gave f word to the poor dog. Very disappointed about the restaurant environment. Very dirty place. Very rude people"
Green China Grill,"you really have too much time in your hand man. you post reviews over and over again. call my servers ugly, then you delete the comments. then commented again. and have your ignorant friend lying about us ""not pets friendly"". you're so hateful, act like a man, you have too much free time in your hand. don't you have a restaurant, too ??  you're ""famous"" in a lot restaurants you know that right? if you are a restaurant owner yourself, too. you know what respect means. and to put false information about other restaurant its really not a good look for you. you keep saying we have dogs in the restaurant, then your friend said we are not pet friendly. you guys are two walking contradiction, like which one is it ?? lol.  anyways. just putting it out there. we are very busy, and staying busy. thanks for your concern friend. as I said, you're welcome back anytime. we will give you better service. but don't make up lies about my place just because things didn't go your way. take a deep breath, its no big deal."
Green China Grill,Love their hand-pulled noodle. Excellent quality that rivals many of the top noodle places in LA. It makes my return to San Diego a worthwhile decision.
Green China Grill,"Took my father and sister here for the first time. Dad had some trouble opening the digital menu on his phone. Sharp staff noticed this from afar and brought paper menus immediately. One of the employees named Chris then came over and explained various items on the menu, his recommendations, how their noodles differed from other restaurants, etc. Helped my father and sister pick the sirloin noodle soup & spinach noodle soup. He also gave us a free cold vegetable appetizer dish since it was their first time. We got the lamb & chicken skewers and beef pancake for appetizers. Everything tasted delicious. My sister thought the noodles & soup were very fresh and delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant for authentic Chinese cooking. The massive number of Mandarin speaking customers was evidence of that. Great service and attention to detail. Five stars!"
Green China Grill,the noodle is very professional. We plan a trip to here for this restaurant from LA. hope they can open a branch in LA:).
Green China Grill,I appreciate you.
Green China Grill,"This is a must try for their specialty Hand Pull noodles. So delicious! The noodles are chewy and smooth that comes in different sizes to your own preference. The noodles are freshly and made to order., that's the best part.Chris , our server was great and we love him! He recommended us to try the spinach noodles especially in stir fried style, and oh my, that was so full of flavors!Chris even requested the chef to make the noodles less chewy for our little one so it would be easier for her to eat. That was very thoughtful of him.This will be one of our favorite spots to come to for noodles & and soup."
Green China Grill,thank you so much my dear for coming to our restaurant. welcome anytime and some other dishes we have. and thank you for your kind review.
Green China Grill,We ordered chicken plates.But most meat have just bone.Totally different with pictures. Greasy.We stopped eating and throwing mostly.
Green China Grill,"First time here and it was amazing ! Our server was Chris and he was very friendly and prompt. Also, he had excellent food suggestions, we ordered everything he suggested and it was great. He even made suggestions for our 2.5 year old, and brought her an egg which she loved ! To the food-spicy oil noodle - extremely good quality , great flavor and very filling .Beef pancake was described as a ""must have"" and did not disappoint ! Chicken skewers - meat tasted fresh and flavorful . My husband got the beef noodle soup and he loved it.There is a lady you can watch making the noodles from scratch, my daughter got a kick out of that , she is very instagrammable. What a gem! Will be back !"
Green China Grill,"So glad we tried this place! We decided to split the beef pancake and a bowl of the braised beef noodles. This type of Chinese cuisine I'm not really familiar with and I had never tried hand pulled noodles. I was really impressed! You can see the lady pulling the noodles so that was cool and the noodles were so good! Great flavor on its own. Really nice texture and chew. With the broth and meat? Phenomenal. With a tea soy sauce egg? Delish. Portions? Between my husband and I, splitting a bowl and an appetizer was perfect for lunch. The beef pancakes were good too. A little too much onion and not enough beef but flavor was good. Star of the show are the hand pulled noodles though. It was absolutely just delicious. They were busy when we came but the service was nice!  Our server was so friendly! As someone who just loves food in general and loves soup noodles, this place is a must try!"
Green China Grill,"Christine dear, thank you so much for the kind review. im so glad you enjoyed our food. we always provide good service to our customers. you're welcome back anytime and try different dishes here. god bless."
Green China Grill,First time here and very impressed with the menu.  They make handmade noodles in front of your eyes.  I will definitely try their beef hotpot next time.
Green China Grill,thank you ana !
Green China Grill,"It's one of the best northwestern Chinese noodle place, my family goes there when we visit SD area. The popular dishes are yummy and will keep you coming back for more"
Green China Grill,thank you so much.
Green China Grill,"The first time I went to this restaurant was 4 days ago and I'm back already! They have many different types of hand pulled noodles made fresh (you can even see them making it behind the counter). I've also had the spicy chili oil noodles, beef/sour cabbage pancakes, and lamb skewers. I've found the food here to be authentic and comforting! Their service is very good and staff are super attentive. When I returned the second time, they even remembered me and gave me a free tea egg. This is a place I would bring my Chinese parents when they visit San Diego!"
Green China Grill,"My wife and I tried this place today. Upon walking in, we were greeted by whom we assumed was the manager. Unfortunately, we didn't get his name, but he was a real nice guy. Super friendly. We were seated right away. We ordered the braised beef noodles and the beef pancake to share. The noodles are handmade. You can literally see the lady making them. They were cooked perfectly. You could taste how fresh they were. Broth was flavorful and delicious. The beef pancake was soo good. The recent harsh reviews seem personal. I don't know what's going on there. Yes, they were a little busy, but we had a great experience all around. We definitely will be returning. To the management....  just know haters will hate. That's what they do. Keep doing what you do. Thank you for a great Sunday lunch."
Green China Grill,"thank you so very much, John. your kind words means the world to me. come back anytime."
Green China Grill,"Gorgeous hand pulled noodles, rich soups replete with a clean, nourishing flavor, and a friendly staff. My favorite!"
Green China Grill,"The inside is nice and bright. Just dined here tonight, was our first time. Service is excellent, staff is attentive friendly, and courteous. Team worked well together. We had the 3 combo appetizers: dried tofu, seaweed, and cucumbers, slightly a bit sweet for our taste, but still able to eat it all, wasn't too terrible. Next we had two types of soups: sour cabbage beef noodle soup and braised beef noodle, both were very good and easy to eat. We had two different noodles, sliced noodles and hand pulled (skinny round), and Interestingly, the skinnier round noodle was definitely more firm, and had more texture.We also had the sirloin skewers, got 4 of them, reasonable serving size for the price. Taste and flavor were satisfying. Parking is a little hard, just like anywhere else on Convoy. Accepts cash, credit cards and Venmo payments."
Green China Grill,"Wandered in here with a friend today and was surprised to find some of the best Chinese noodles in town. We ordered two noodle dishes: one was a sirloin noodle soup and the other was a cold sesame noodle dish, served with crunchy julienned cucumbers (excellent on a hot summer day). The noodles were prepared by hand by the chef, who we could see pulling and separating the dough through a glass window, and they turned out to be wonderfully long and chewy -- perfect in texture and so fresh! On top of this, the staff were all very nice and welcoming to us and my dog. The interior, recently redone, was clean and welcoming. Their house-made chili oil was really good.Overall the food we tried seemed to be great value: fresh, authentic, and relatively healthy compared to some of the other Chinese food options in the area.Highly recommend and will be coming back soon!"
Green China Grill,"thank you Janet for your sweet review !! I'm so glad you enjoyed your experience at green china grill, and we loved your little puppy ;>"
Green China Grill,"Out of all the San Diego Chinese restaurants, the food quality was by far the worst I've had. The food was soo bland and lacking flavor I started thinking that something was wrong with my palate. The spicy chicken noodle had very little bit of meat and was mainly onions, potatoes and noodles. To add insult to injury, the portions of the food were miniscule. You guys should know better, especially when you have an outstanding restaurant like Spicy City right next to you. I will never come back here again.Edit to reply: Amy whether you feel okay with what I said or not, it is not a personal attack on you. I am leaving an honest review about my experience with your establishment and your food quality. Thats what Yelp is for. I gave your restaurant 1 star review because I simply did not like the food, portion of the food or the service."
Green China Grill,"we are very sorry that you had a bad experience with us. I'm always very nice to my customers. but for you and you girlfriend Hannah to both say bad things about our restaurant to make us seem worthless, im not okay with that. you have too much time in your hand. if you don't like our place, no matter how good we are you would put us down anyways. you're doing this on purpose. our customer who knows us will always come back so you can take a walk somewhere on convoy hope you find somewhere better. oh spicy city is next to us, here you go. have a good night."
Green China Grill,"Best Chinese noodles hands down.  They have hand pulled and hand stretch noodles, it's chewy and you don't want to stop slurrping for more noodles. The beef broth of the soup is clean and not too greasy. It's so good I crave it once a month. I been addicted to spicy oil spinach noodles lately. Also CHRIS is amazing he welcome us and was so friendly with my kids they love coming here !!! THX CHRIS you the MVP!"
Green China Grill,"If you like fresh made noodle, this is the perfect place. They made noodle on the spot bowl by bowl and it tastes great. The place is really for noodle so they give you lots of noodle and maybe too little meat. If you are a meat lover you will think it's expensive. It's hard to finish the whole bowl. The soup taste good and the beef is very tender. I really love the lamp skewers and I think it's very authentic (also according to my Chinese friend). You can also order a cold dish as appetizer (3 choices per dish). I really like the spicy beef intestine (not sure what they call it) and the seaweed salad. The food comes out very quickly. The service was amazing and the waitresses were very nice. I asked them if I could take a video of the lady making the noodle and they allowed me to fill her. She even apologized because she was nervous and made mistake (I did not notice) and asked if I wanted to refilm her."
Green China Grill,"I am obsessed with this place. They have the best noodles in town. Every noodle you order is handmade. You can pick any size for your noodle. They cool part is that they make in front of you eyes. And their Grill skewers are really bomb! My personal fave is the lamb skewers and the Mantou slices skewers. Would highly recommend, and will be back soon."
Green China Grill,Honestly super nice and caring workers. Was so pleasantly surprised. The environment was also clean and comfortable.
Green China Grill,"Be on the look out for scam!!!First, their prices are $1 more than what's showing on the menu. Second, they will not provide an itemized receipt except for the receipt to sign...why?! Because they have discreetly added a generous 20% service charge on your tap and by not knowing you will most likely sign another additional 15%-20% on top of that. Food is ok, nothing authentic about it. Portion on the small side, $2.5 for a can of Coke...lol"
Green China Grill,"hey there. first of all thank you so much for coming to our restaurant. we just recently higher our price by $1, and our new menu is coming out next Monday. that's why before we take your order we let you guys know, we let every single customer know before taking the order.  I remember we told you guys twice before we take your orders.  our restaurant is well know in asian community, we provide good service and foods, we will never scam our customers. lastly, for the service fee, we automatically add that for the party of 5-6 or more people, for that,   I do sincerely apologize for that for not letting you guys know. we were super busy as you can see today, and it was 100% our fault for not letting you know. once again, I want to apologize to you my friend, and come back anytime we will make it better. have a wonderful night."
Green China Grill,"Very authentic noodles. They can make any noodle in soup or fried noodle. And I love the skewers, especially very flavorful lamb skewers and snow beef skewers. My personal favorite is the rice noodle, it's a cold fish full with flavors. Very clean restaurant and refreshing. Will be back soon. 这家拉面馆太地道了,简直就是国内的味道。"
Green China Grill,"I am so happy that I walked into Green China Grill a few months ago, it is very, very good and I am an enthusiastic regular now. The noodles are fantastic, all hand made to order, which you can observe through a window into the kitchen. The soups and grilled dishes are all delicious, my favorites are the beef sirloin noodle soup, any of the fried noodle dishes, and cumin spiced chicken. I always start with the wonderful beef pancake. I am getting hungry just writing this!The place has a pleasant, casual vibe, staff is very friendly. They are happy do discuss the menu with you and make recommendations. Great place, nice people, wonderful authentic Chinese."
Green China Grill,The remake a beautiful wall and floor. New environment make me feel so happy. Foods are always great. will definitely come back.
Green China Grill,thank you so much !
Green China Grill,Best LiangPi in town!!! Authentic LiangPi (cold noddle ) from West-North Chinese style. They hand made them daily. Fresh and Goooood. I can eat this EVERYDAY.
Green China Grill,food is too cold when served，especially one of which is supposed to be BBQed. Noddles are ok. Do not order others
Green China Grill,Hi. josh. sorry for the bad experience with us. which dish did you order? we do have some noodles that go through cold water when cooked. its part of the process of making certain type of noodle dishes. id be happy to make it for you again if you decide to come back. have a good day
Green China Grill,"I was actually stalking my ex, when I thought he saw me and I hopped into this restaurant so he wouldn't see me. Hahaha. I ordered a noodle soup and sour cabbage pancake. I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. And the service is wonderful. Super clean restaurant  and the Staff is super funny and easy  to talk to. Will be back soon. Highly recommend."
Green China Grill,"hahaha kel, im glad you liked our food. what a funny experience you had. welcome back anytime."
Green China Grill,"I ordered tomatoes eggs sliced noodles. When the food got here, the noodles were almost FROZEN. Too salty as well. Absolute garbage."
Green China Grill,"hey Delong, I am so very sorry that you had a bad experience here. our tomato and egg sliced noodle is a noun soup dish. so if you do take out, its gonna all get stuck together. also you ordered on uber and the food was ready for a long time until the driver gets here. next time come back to the store and order the same dish and eat at the store, I promise you its going to be better. and my treat, too. hope to see you again so we can make it up for you."
Green China Grill,Came about an hour before closing and they were still bustling (nothing less expected from convoy st.) The staff was extremely friendly and attentive right away. It took less than 10 minutes for our food to come out. We got 1 of everything on the menu. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for something different among the saturation of KBBQ and ramen spots. This is a definite go to.
Green China Grill,"No wait, dishes come out pretty fast, friendly staff, and amazing hand-pulled noodles. Comfortable environment, and the staff make sure to sanitize and clean the tables/ground thoroughly!Favorites:- Choose 3 appetizer/plate- Braised beef noodle soup- Lamb kebab"
Green China Grill,thank you jessie.
Green China Grill,"This used to be a four stars place every time I was craving for beef noodle and beef pancakes. Recently they increased the prices, which is understandable considering most ingredients becoming more expensive. However, the beef in the beef pancakes got way less than before that it should be called onion pancakes for now."
Green China Grill,"Overall a slightly better than average experience. Came on a Saturday with a group of 4 at 11:30 am and was seated immediately. Here's what we got:Beef noodle soup with thin hand pulled noodles: soup is subtle in flavor (it was supposed to be spicy but I didnt get any hint of that). Beef chunks were delicious but they only gave maybe 4 or 5 small pieces. They were generous on the noodle portion though. Noodles were good but soften pretty quickly.Cumin hand pulled noodles: delicious! It's loaded with cumin and onions. Noodles were coated with flavor and oil. Side dishes from the food bar: you need to order these separately by going up to the counter. We had the cucumber, tofu and black fungus (?). They pretty much all had the same flavor, a bit sweet but good!"
Green China Grill,Thank you Joann!
Green China Grill,"During the pandemic time, we wanted to support local restaurants and businesses so we wanted to try as many different restaurants as possible. We came across Green China Grill one night. We were craving some noodle soup so we found this place selling beef noodle soup. We ordered couple of dishes to go. To our surprise, we really loved their beef noodle soup! Chinese beef noodle soup can taste different from different regions of China because people use different ingredients. We loved this simple yet flavorful beef soup! Their noodles are great too! Definitely made in the restaurant! I liked the wide thick noodles that they served. We couldn't get enough of the beef noodle soup. We also liked their stir fried cumin beef noodles. Again, wonderful dish with flavors. Not to salty or oily. Excellent noodles and just cooked perfectly. We also loved their grilled items such as Lamb Skewers and rice bun. We totally loved this place after our first visit so we have been here 3 times in just couple of months. We also tried their Big Plate Chicken which was also great. It seems all the dishes we tried here were great so we are going to be regular customers for sure! So glad that we discovered this noodle place!"
Green China Grill,"This place one hundred percent has left a lasting impression , from a very tentative staff and amazing home style meals.....the fact is; it has left such an impression I ate there yesterday and wanted to leave a review!!!!! And will be going back to enjoy more of there deep and flavorful dishes ....!!!!!!"
Green China Grill,"The first few times I've been to this restaurant for their braised beef noodle soup, I've had good experiences. However, that was years ago, and this recent experience wasn't a good experience.Before grilling and bashing on the food, I'll have to give them a thumbs up for their noodles. The noodles I got are knife cut noodles and the texture is great. You can tell that the noodles aren't cheap ramen noodles, it took more effort to make these noodles. What made me dislike this beef noodle soup dish is, first, the quantity of the meat. I had a large bowl of noodles and just around 5 very small pieces of meat. Now, the worst experience is the soup base. It was just saturated with white pepper. It was so strong that within 5 minutes of eating I could just taste white pepper throughout my throat and mouth. Water didn't help much either. I've had so many beef noodle soup dishes in China, around US, at home, and this has got to be my worst experience.I'm not sure if I'll ever come again now, and I don't think I would recommend this place to my friends anymore. The price also increased here, so I'd rather spend $15 at Menya Ultra or other better noodle places than here."
Green China Grill,"Hi, thanks for your feedback, we have confirmed with our Chef, our soup doesn't contain any white pepper, if you have further questions, please let me know!^-^"
Green China Grill,"As it name says this restaurant is also green inside, parking is very difficult to find during peak hours. Service is good. We came here for the skewers since this seems to be one of their specialties. Unfortunately they do not serve steamed rice I would have love to have eaten my skewers with a cup of rice. We ordered:- Beef and Lamb skewers.- I'm not a fan of cumin so we asked without it and they were very good and tasty but I think the portions were kind of small. - Spicy hot oil noodles.- good and spicy. - Bake bread.- unfortunately for me they add cumin to them but they had a good taste and the cumin flavor wasn't overpowering but I would have preferred them without it. Overall it was a good experience."
Green China Grill,"Hi, Rene, sorry for that inconvenience, we have white rice to serve now, wish you can come to our restaurant again!"
Green China Grill,Stupid and evil people! Plus dirty food! Be careful of the hairs in your plate! Will never recommend!
Green China Grill,"Suuuuper authentic Northern Chinese food, so authentic and right it made my friend a grown man cry. Recommend getting the lamb skewers and the big plate chicken. This place just feels so comfortable and homey it's insane, food is great too and fairly priced."
Green China Grill,"Fresh handmade noodles are sublime, as were the pancake appetizers. Highly recommended"
Green China Grill,"Food is ok!  But there is the problem of arbitrary charges.  Check it out carefully before paying.  The waiter will ask you to pay by cash or credit card when ordering.  If it is a cash payment method, there will be a 10% discount.  But at the time of checkout, the bill is the full charge plus a 20% service charge.  When I asked about a 10% discount on cash payment.  They are not willing to give me a 10% discount, but the 20% service fee is still adjusted according to the original without discount (with pictures), so please read carefully before paying.  2 stars are for food."
Green China Grill,"Delicious fresh noodles, can't wait to be back. Great customer service, very attentive."
Green China Grill,"First time here and the restaurant was pretty packed. Didn't have to wait long before being seated. The staff are very friendly and the food is delicious! They make fresh hand pulled noodles for their dishes. I loved their skewers and braised beef noodle soup! Glad I came in to try it, I will be back soon!"
Green China Grill,"For the last 6 years, Green China Grill has been my go-to spot in San Diego for amazing braised beef noodle soup. Quality has not changed since the day I've been here, and COVID hasn't seem to shake this restaurant. You can see the noodles being hand made from the window they have into the kitchen, and the soup is clean, but still felt rich with flavor and spices. Chris especially made me feel extra welcome and comfortable during my time here with new and recurring customers. We'll all be coming back whenever we get a chance to be in the area."
Green China Grill,"I was in town for a conference. There's not a lot of great authentic Chinese food where I'm from, so I did some research on the best options for hand-pulled noodles. This place did not disappoint! We made a reservation and they had a table waiting. We tried both the hand-pulled noodles, the cut noodles, the beef pancake and the skewers. It was all incredibly fresh, delicious and really authentic. The service was great and the price was fair. It was also a lot of fun to watch them making the noodles through the window into the kitchen. The manager Chris even gave us a tip on where to get dessert nearby."
Green China Grill,"My boyfriend and I love their noodles! They are fresh hand pulled/cut noodles and you can watch them make them onsite. We also really enjoyed  their cold side dishes such as wood ear mushrooms, celery with bean curd, and shredded potatoes. The soup broth that they serve with the noodles is so flavorful. The restaurant is very clean and I felt very safe and welcomed there."
Green China Grill,"I am so glad you enjoy the food my dear, come back anytime ;>"
Green China Grill,Came for lunch for the first time today and the food was so good I can't wait to come back!The noodles are perfect texture and the lamb skewers are phenomenal. Service was friendly and helpful.
Green China Grill,"Really good, enjoyed everything we ordered have to try the beef pancakes and chicken/lamb skewers!! I will be returning"
Green China Grill,"Came here on a weekend and was able to get seated immediately. After looking over the menu, we ordered a spicy beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles and a fried cumin noodle stir fry.They serve the food as it is ready, so we got the noodle soup and the stir fry took another 5 min or so. The broth on the soup was clear, and a bit bland. We added the chili sauce, which helped quite a bit. The beef was very tender and the noodles initially had a nice mouth feel with a good bite to it. About 2/3 of the way through, the noodles started losing their consistency and softening quite a bit. From al dente to almost mush. It was the better of the two dishes.The stir fry dish tasted like what you might get from a panda express. There wasn't much meat, and it was quite oily. We added the chili sauce/oil to this as well to help with the flavor. We can't say that we were too impressed with what we had."
Green China Grill,"Hi, Kim, we do recommend the thicker noodle for the noodle soup, then it won't so soften so quick, and we have updated it recently, wish you can come and try again!"
Green China Grill,"We were just looking around on convoy st. The so called Asian nation lol,  and found this place on Yelp. Me and my wife loved Green China Grill. We came in kinda late around 8:45, and we were told the kitchen is going to close in 5 mins. The waiter welcomed us in, and spent time to explained us  the menu super patiently and gave us recommendations, He didn't make us feel rushed or anything, even though they're closing at 9pm. He recommend the Spicy Oil Noodles and Braised Beef noodle soup. They were superb! Reminded me the noodle I had while I was in China. They make the noodle fresh in front of your eye that's pretty cool. The noodle is super tasty and chewy, and the beef is tender and flavorful. They soup is to die for, Warm and full of flavors. The only thing is that I hope they give you more cilantros in the noodles. Lol We enjoyed the food, and the service was wonderful. Our waiter waited til we finished dinner, Thanks again Green China Grill. We will be back."
Green China Grill,We just had our first lunch at the Green China Grill.  We're former travel photographers so we've done our share of eating our way through most of the world so so it was a pleasant surprise to experience some truly authentic food from the Tarim Basin in China (where most of the Uyghurs live) right here is the San Diego County US. If you're interested in something that's truly an amazing cuisine; the Green China Grill is your kind of place.  They make their own noodles (an art form in itself) right in front of your eyes.  Everything is totally fresh and the service is amazing.
Green China Grill,"I don't know what was more green: the title of the restaurant or the faces of my friends when I told them about the delicious food I ate! A great establishment with fresh made noodles, homey feeling skewers, and a kinda staff to match. Come here for an authentic experience! -Ernesto"
Green China Grill,"The beef noodle (clear broth) is so good!! It has vegetable, cilantro, daikon, and beef slices (this is not Taiwanese beef noodle so don't expect the big tender chunks) as toppings, and the broth tasted so flavorful and full bodied. Noodles were perfect, you can really tell the texture difference with the hand pulled noodles. If you have had Lanzhou beef noodle before you will agree this place is legit. Lamb skewers were also very good, I like that you can taste the smokiness of the grill (gotta eat it ASAP). Beef and sour cabbage pancake was good, but the texture of the dough can be more layered. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was friendly and fluent in both English and Chinese. Been looking for a home-ly Chinese soup noodle place in SD and I think this is it! We will be back to try the rest of the noodles. Also they do charge for to go containers but you can bring your own reusable container to save money and save the planet :)"
Green China Grill,thank you Erica. I'm so happy you enjoyed the food here. come back anytime ;>
Green China Grill,"First time here and I was SO impressed! The vibe is fresh and bright, and the food was incredible- super authentic and fresh. The manager Chris was so helpful and gave us great recommendations, and all our food came out so fast!! Will definitely be back"
Green China Grill,"If a restaurant serves beef noodle soup I have to try it!I came here because of a friend's recommendation. I was warned that I won't get a lot of beef but I'll get a lot of noodle for their beef noodle soup.And that is exactly what I got and this is also why I only gave 4 stars. I'm usually not a fan of the braised beef so having very little of them isn't a problem for me, but the problem is that I don't think it's worth what I paid for. Other than that, I like their soup base and overall the noodle soup is good!"
Green China Grill,Thank you Cynthia!
Green China Grill,"4 Stars!  I love this place. They only make the noodles when you order, no premade noodles here so you can expect freshly made noodles every time you order! The noodle soup is a big portion so highly recommend that you share and try their different dishes on the menu.  I notice that they use cummins and other types of herbs, so you might or might not like it, but I don't mind. Also if you pay by cash, you get 10% off your entire bill. Yes, I will definitely come back and highly recommend this place for noodle lovers."
Green China Grill,"Thank you, Molly!"
Green China Grill,"I tried green china grill over the pandemic when they first reopened and got their takeout which was good already, but dining in was a great experience! Their interior is bright and colorful (light green walls) and the waiter was super friendly and helpful. The menu includes pictures of the noodle sizes to help you decide, but our waiter still walked through them with us and told us his favorites/recommendations. I ordered the beef noodle soup with regular sized noodles but since I like thicker noodles I think I could've gotten the thick ones instead. Each table (also in takeout orders) has their homemade chili oil which is so good if you enjoy spicy food. I couldn't finish my food so I let my friends finish the meat that came with my order and they said my meat was tough compared to theirs, but since I didn't eat it I can't comment on it. Would definitely add this to the rotation for noodle soup cravings!!"
Green China Grill,"Hi Megan, love. thank you so much for you kind review. come back anytime and try different dishes."
Green China Grill,If you are looking for great authentic Chinese food at a good price come here. Almost everything is made from scratch and is very fresh. You can even watch them make the noodles right before you eat them. The restaurant is also very clean. There is a good variety of spicy Sichuan food and fresh cold summer food.
Green China Grill,thank you so much Jason !!!
Green China Grill,"(An indoor restaurant) If you don't mind a dog sit on the chair right next to your table and shake its body frequently, the dusts later flows over to you table, then it's a good place to go. The food are decent."
Green China Grill,"very tasty chinese style noodle, definitely recommend for friends who want to try legit chinese style food."
Green China Grill,"Great service, and super fast. Noodles, soup, and beef are made perfectly every time."
Green China Grill,"Great service, amazing food, would recommend to anyone. Ask for Chris, an amazing honest server who will give you an amazing experience!"
Green China Grill,Great food and great service. Our server Chris made sure that we had the best experience possible and helped us order dishes we would like. Everything was fantastic.
Green China Grill,Great authentic food and kind service! Perfect warm soup for the soul on a chilly afternoon.
Green China Grill,"These sour cabbage beef pancakes are the frickin bomb holy moly. Oh and let's not forget to mention the fresh knife cut noodles, which are pulled freshly right in front of you! You can't go wrong with the cucumber sesame noodles or the beef knife cut noodle soup!I came here for the first time because Tasty Pot had a massive wait and I've been coming back to this place more than I have Tasty Pot since then. You really can't find the same taste you find here anywhere else. Savory, comforting, and delicious. The only downsides to this place are the portion sizes aren't the biggest. For $11 you don't get a lot of beef and noodles, but they are FRESH, so you're paying for quality over quantity; keep that in mind. Also, parking is a pain the BUTT, especially during weekend peak hours. It's just Convoy being Convoy, so keep that in mind too.Overall, this place is underrated because everyone comes to this place to go to Tasty Pot, but definitely come here if you get a chance and/or are craving some dank soup."
Green China Grill,Worst customer service. Demanded use venmo or with a additional fee with credit card to order over the phone. The lady there are all pretty rude. Food is mediocre and the boss lady is super ignorant as well. The employees were just standing and not doing anything
Green China Grill,Their food is really good I love their beef broth. But the customer service can really use some work. I will love to see they improve on that. Other than that the food is 10/10.
Green China Grill,"This place has been around for a long time, you can easily recognize it with its Shrek green walls. Unfortunately it's pretty slept on as it's next to Spicy City and China Max, both Convoy staples. I finally went a few days ago- I'm a big carb girl whose parents are from the Northwest of China, so we love a good hand pulled noodle. This place definitely doesn't disappoint! It has noodle dishes (beef noodles are their speciality), shish kebabs, and other cold dishes. I got the beef and spicy/sour pickled vegetable noodle soup with knife cut noodles (you can see them slice the noodles/pull the noodles through the kitchen window), and my boyfriend got cold hand pulled noodles with cucumber slivers and a sesame sauce. We shared roasted, seasoned mantou (steamed bread) which was dusted w/ chili powder and cumin. I loved the mantou, it was spicy, fragrant, and crunchy. Garlic bread WHO? I liked the al dente-ness of the hand pulled colled noodles and wish there was more of that sensation with my knife cut noodles, which got soft quickly after sitting in the broth. My only complaint is that there were 3-4 slices of thin beef in my soup (the beef was tasty though). Will be back!"
Green China Grill,"Thank you, Nathalie!"
Green China Grill,"My rating is more like a 3.5, but the quality of the noodles definitely bumped it up! I ordered the handpulled beef and sour cabbage noodle soup and here were my thoughts:PROS:- Flavorful enough broth. It wasn't too diluted and I enjoyed mine with sour cabbage and a bit of chili oil! (Be careful not to go too heavy-handed with it though)- some of the BEST noodles I've ever had! They weren't dry, but still had a bit of a chew to to them without being obnoxious and annoying to eat.- VERY GENEROUS portion of noodles, I couldn't even finish them!- fair to decent pricing- service wasn't bad, averageCONS:- I only had three thin slices of beef... Finished them in the first few minutes of eating and ended up only really eating noodles for the rest of the meal- parking in this plaza is horrendous, unsurprising, but never gets not annoying - sour cabbage wasn't quite sour enough for me, but not a big deal breaker"
Green China Grill,"Thanks for the suggestions, we have improved our menu recently, wish you can come and try!"
Green China Grill,"I got their signature sirloin noodle soup and was able to try the lamb and beef skewers. Everything was excellent! The noodle from the sirloin noodle soup was so firm and tender at the same time, it's pretty ridiculous. I was expecting the soup base to be a little bland since its a lighter broth and I read some reviews saying that it might be tasteless, but it came to my surprise that the broth was very flavorful. One thing I want to complain about is the amount of beef in the soup. There were like 4-5 slices of beef only, it would've been great if there was more.The lamb and beef skewers are definitely something worth ordering as well. They are not shy about using those spices, just the way I like it! Overall, service was prompt and attentive on a week day lunch. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a taste of fresh noodles!"
Green China Grill,"LOVE this place. Have been going here since 2016 and always always top notch service and the food is bombbbbb. I always get the beef pancake ( my favorite apps ) and the brisket noodles soup. If you love noodles, give this place a try. I love it and I've never been a fan of noodles soup but this will change your mind!! Also don't forget to try their skewers, it's sooooo good!! 10 out of 10"
Green China Grill,Nice restaurant with authentic Chinese food plus the service is great highly recommended!
Green China Grill,"And forget to mention their customer services,  mostly are girl working here and all of them are treating people nicely with patience. I like it."
Green China Grill,"Recommend to any handsome men and pretty ladys who are cravying for a comfort food. Me and my family visited Green China Grill three times already, love their authentic beef noodle soup, clear but also tasty broth with their fresh made ""Lan Zhou兰州"" hand pull wheat noodle. And don't forget to try put the grilled beef scewers and lamb scewers as appetizers, they are fantastic!"
Green China Grill,"This is a clean, simply decorated restaurant. The menu is easy enough, not too extensive. Staff and service are okay.I got the vegetables and eggs fried noodles (H), which had onion, tomato, cabbage, green pepper, carrot, and egg. The noodles were alright, possibly freshly made, they were maybe a minute undercooked but were fine. The flavor for the dish was alright, a little oily, it just smelled like chinese food. I wish there was a little garlic flavor to enhance it. It's a good portion for the price, since they noodles are made in house (allegedly)."
Green China Grill,"This restaurant was awesome, the food was Chinese traditional! Love it!  By the way, the wall's picture attractive and so we are enjoy the environment!"
Green China Grill,thank you my friend. I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Green China Grill,"November 2017: Can you say hot hot hot.... this place was a pleasant surprise. We were actually in this plaza for another restaurant craving for hand pull noodles and realized the restaurant had been replaced.  So walking to our cars we see pictures outside this restaurant it seems as if they have hand pull noodles.  So of course we went to check out the menu and lucky us this was what we wanted without having to drive to another restaurant.  It was packed but one available table for us. Seems as everyone speaks mandarin,  employees and customers.  So seems like the place to be. We asked for suggestions and was recommend to get the hot oil noodle. Which we did and it was hot hot hot but so good good good. I did have heartburn after I ate it. The noodles are perfect I couldn't stop looking at the ladies making the noodles.  The right amount of thickness. The right amount of chew and the right amount of sauce. How did I not know about this place I? One down side to this dish is that there's nothing in it but noodles and sauce. But it didn't bother me I'm all about the carbs. We also ordered their cold noodles that comes with cucumbers and sesame paste.  This was so good as well and definitely refreshing.  It helped cooled down my mouth after each bite of the hot oil noodle.  I love sesame paste so I already knew this dish was also a winner.On the side we had the beef pancakes that has sour cabbage inside.  This was different I have never had the sour cabbage with this dish before and it was actually a great balance. A bit oily than what I'm used to but the cabbage helped with that."
Green China Grill,"Beef pancake is not bad- almost as good as the one at 101 Noodle House. The appetizers are surprisingly good. Is it weird that I find the potato salad too addicting? Use caution if you have low spiciness tolerance, or just forget about it and ask for a whole jar of ice water ...Some staff seem to be still in training. Will come back and check for improvement."
Green China Grill,"Hi, our menu and all services are all developed! Wish you can come and try again!"
Green China Grill,"Clean place, decent food. Everything was all good until when we're almost finished. I don't like raw onions, and my noodle had onions in it... I didn't know when I ordered. Anyways, no biggie I could just pick them out. All was still fine until one of the waitress or owner maybe came asking me if I don't like onions, so I answered yes. She then said to me that I should've said it earlier and they could've not added it. I then replied in a apologetic tone telling her I didn't know when I ordered... She finally walked away.Now this would've been fine with me if she hadn't used a crappy tone talking down on me, and constantly circling back as if she's having her eyes on me for trying to waste more food.Shame. Decent food, bad attitude from one bxtch waitress."
Green China Grill,"Their handpulled noodles are amazing!! I got the beef noodle soup. The broth was pretty good but I decided to give it an extra kick and add some chili oil. The noodles were fantastic as well as the flavor of the beef! I only wish they gave more beef, but the large amount of noodles they gave made up for it and I ended up really full. I also ordered the pancake with a mix of sour cabbage and beef. I thought it would be a pretty flat pancake, but it was more of a burrito size!! The pancake would definitely make a delicious snack!Service was also pretty good. The waiter refilled out waters when it was running low and was overall super friendly! Finally the green decor and atmosphere was definitely cheery and upbeat :)"
Green China Grill,Braised Beef Noodle soup never disappoints. Best pulled noddles in San Diego. 5 star review! Chris was very inviting & courteous. Thanks again.
Green China Grill,thank you so much for your review my friend. welcome anytime !
Green China Grill,2nd time here. Got an early dinner so place was quite empty. Got a seat right away and the waitress took my order:Beef wraps with mustard greensHand-pulled noodle soup Lamb skewersI didn't have to wait long for my order. All the items I ordered were delicious. I took a portion of it home. Would come back again. FYI: There's a clear window where you can view the person making the fresh hand-pulled noodles.
Green China Grill,"Green China Grill is a new Chinese Restaurant on Convoy in Kearny Mesa (opened in December 2015).  The food is authentic.  YAY!  The restaurant is known for their hand pulled noodles as well as kebabs (featured from Lanzhou - region in Western China).  My dining partner and I ordered the following:- Roasted Chicken Kebab - dark meat chicken on metal skewers flavored with lots of different flavors and lots of cumin.  YUM!- Braised Beef Brisket Noodle Soup - marinated beef with lots of flavor.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and ""al dente"".  Broth was clear and had a slight floral taste.  YUM!- Spinach Noodle Soup with Beef - marinated beef with lots of flavor.  The noodles were a tad overcooked, so it was more soggy than I would have preferred.   Broth was also clear and had a slight floral taste.TIP 1:  Be sure to watch the fresh hand pulled noodles being pulled from the dough into long thin strands (in the window at the back of the restaurant).  It is pretty neat to watch if you have never seen it before.TIP 2:  The staff at the restaurant seem speak limited English.  Our waitress spoke to us in Chinese; I comprehended what I could based on my limited Mandarin and replied back in English.  When ordering, I spoke in English and pointed to the item on the menu to make sure that our waitress understood.  In the same token, expect service to not be so great (compared to American standards).  If you need something, don't be afraid to raise your hand to flag down a waiter / waitress.  Be assertive!ENJOY!"
Green China Grill,"I was surprised that this place with hand pulled noodles has been open for a year and I've never heard about it until now. However, upon trying the food I can see why this place has not been hyped compared to Shan Xi Magic Kitchen. The current rating of 3.5/5 stars is exactly what I'd give this place. + Spinach Beef Noodles (3/5): The broth is very light which may not be to some people's taste. I didn't think it was bad, but it could definitely have used more flavor. I usually don't have a reaction to MSG but after eating this, my throat felt fuzzy. The beef they give is OK but they only give like 3 pieces of it. Also, the ratio of broth to noodles to beef is just completely off. There are way too many noodles for how much broth and meat there is. The texture of the noodles itself is amazing! I love how chewy they are and how you can see the people pulling the noodles through the window.+ Beef Braised Noodles (3/5): Same commentary as above. Not enough meat or flavor but delicious noodles.+ Beef and Sour Cabbage Pancakes (3/5): The dough is perfectly flaky and delicious but there is almost no filling at all! The beef is basically nonexistent and just the sour cabbage inside doesn't give it enough flavor. This is just dry and lacking. For $9, there's absolutely no way I'd order this again.Overall, the quality of the noodles REALLY saves this place. I would give this place a 5/5 if I was solely basing it off of the noodles! I wish I could buy them alone and add them to my dad's beef noodle soup for the best beef noodle soup combination. However, the bland and MSG filled broth, the stingy portion of meat, and the lack of filling inside the pancake brings this place down to a 3.5 stars. Also, the prices here is too expensive for the quality you get."
Green China Grill,"Decor: Very nice and clean. Love the green walls and everything. It makes the whole restaurant bright! Service: The waitresses were all very friendly. No complaints whatsoever FOOD: Yum! I ordered a noodle dish with lamb skewers. Lamb skewers were perfectly seasons and oh so juicy! You can't go wrong with them. The noodle soup dishes do not have a lot of meat at all so what I did was order lam skewers to get that extra protein. I got the beef soup with spinach noodles (you can substitute the plain noodles with spinach). Very yummy! The meat was melt in your mouth. The broth slightly reminds me of pho with a different spice, I can't put my finger on it. The noodles are really the star of the party. Since they are home made, they have that awesome delectable, chewy texture.  Only regret is there is not a lot of meat. The noodle to meat ratio is pretty ridiculous. But oh wells. The portions are great for the price. Id come here again. :)"
Green China Grill,"Noodles vs rice?  Well, my carb of choice will always be noodles, so when I read about homemade noodles I was in a hurry to check this place out. I visited about a month after opening and I think they were still working out the kinks because their menu was still pretty limited. I was bummed that they were sold out of the braised beef noodle soup, so I had to go with the sirloin beef noodle soup instead.The sirloin beef noodle soup was good. They were were extremely generous with the noodles and it was fun to watch them be pulled through the window. The toppings consisted mainly of cilantro and radish. The real star of the meal were those hearty noodles though. At $7.99 this might be one of the best noodle deals on Convoy. My date and I also shared some spicy beef skewers that reminded me of King Bistro (on Diane Ave.). Would definitely get these again!The waitstaff seemed friendly, although they didn't come around asking if we needed anything."
Green China Grill,"I see now why this place is called Green China Grill! All there chairs are lime green and woven. They were very comfy! This casual eatery has a bright, clean, and modern vibe.My friend found parking first, so she grabbed a table for us. Their menu seemed to have quite a few options, but a lot of the items were not available when we were ready to order. We ended up sharing a large bowl of sirloin noodle soup and grilled squid skewers since she wasn't too hungry. The food was ready pretty fast! I loved the noodles cause they were so fresh! The broth was tasty as well. I was surprised that the squid was so yummy too.Service wasn't that great, but it might just be a language barrier. While we were waiting for our bill, I peeked through the back window and saw a lady making the hand pulled noodles. It was fun to watch and very fascinating. It reminds me of those pretzel makers at the mall."
Green China Grill,"DON'T get their grilled chicken and lamb. They feel pre-boiled.DON'T get their pan-fried noodles. They get overcooked.DO get their Noodles with Braised Beef Brisket. The noodles taste fresh and the flavor is savory and clean. ABSOLUTELY get their Beef and Sour Cabbage Sliced Noodle Soup (the noodles are hand sliced!).Fresh noodles taste much better when they are hand-cut into imperfect pieces. These elements make the noodles fun to chew on. It seems like there's always someone making noodles. Maybe it's just for show, but who knows? The noodles generally taste fresh. That's all that matters."
Green China Grill,I wanted fresh hand pulled noodles. The noodles here were pretty good. I will definitely be back. The chicken skewers was seasoned nicely. Full of flavor!
Green China Grill,Thank you Tnt!
Green China Grill,"Duuuuude. Hand. Pulled. Noodles. There is such a big difference between store bought noodles and fresh ones. Once you've had fresh noodles, it's hard to go back home to store bought ones. I got the hot oil noodles and it was everything I wanted. Precaution: it actually is spicy! I would say it's a 7/8 on the spicy scale. But man, the noodles are amazing. Nothing beats having a mouth full of carbs honestly. The only thing I wish was that it also came with meat. I got beef skewers on the side and they were okay, really tastes like cumin. Kinda expensive for 4 skewers, small pieces of meat and large pieces of fat on each one."
Green China Grill,My friend and I came here to try their homemade noodles and it didn't disappoint. It was sooo delicious. I got the hot and spicy noodle with broth which was $2 extra and my friend got the noodle soup with beef. We also bought some buns and lamb skewers which was also amazing!! Overall we both was full and happy. We definitely will be coming back again to try the rest of the dishes. I tried to take a picture of the lady making fresh noodles but she moves too fast and it came up blurry. But the noods is definitely super fresh and AMAZING
Green China Grill,"Thank you, Maya！"
Green China Grill,"Real deal beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles (finally!!! it's so hard to find good 牛肉拉面, FYI for newbies to get the full experience you need to dump in as much chili oil as you can tolerate). Like other reviewers said, not that much beef (which is too bad because it's yummy) but a lot of noodle. My advice to the restaurant is to add a dollar or two to the price and add more beef. The snow beef skewer and beef and cabbage rolls were also delicious."
Green China Grill,I just come America like few day and this is my first place I came . For seriously I like this place the noodles is awesome noodles really nice and Got a that sour pancakes that all thing is a handmade and so fast  that  . All thing is cheap and nice 5start absolutely I will be back .
Green China Grill,Room full of customers...we are the only europeans in the room.  Decor:  4 stars.  Who doesn't Love lime green and bright orange decor?Service:  3 stars.  Wouldn't call them friendly but they get the job done and the food came out in a timely manner.Food:  Really good. The Brasse had an interesting flavor that I can't quite put my hands on. Maybe cilantro? I had the spinach noodles with beef and they were delicious. The noodles are hand pulled and you can see them being made in the back. They had a nice meaty consistency which I enjoy. Really good. The Brasse had an interesting flavor that I can't quite put my hands on. Maybe cilantro? I had the spinach noodles with beef and they were delicious. The noodles are hand pulled and you can see them being made in the back. They had a nice meaty consistency which I enjoy.The best part is there was no wait. So many places on convoy street are packed with people who read other yelp reviews. Apparently this place is been missed and it does seem to get less good reviews. I'm guessing because it's very simple food and they don't have a huge number of options.If you just want beef noodle soup (no chicken) this is the place to go.
Green China Grill,This is my favorite place to eat traditional Chinese noodle. Very nice place. The bbq is also professional!
Green China Grill,"Thank you, Johnny!"
Green China Grill,"I have been here before, and I thought the noodles were amazing. However, even though we are still in a pandemic, the chefs and cooks were NOT wearing masks while cooking the food. The waiter and waitress only wore masks when they came to take our order, but took OFF the mask when handling the food, which is probably the most important time to be wearing a mask...very disappointed"
Green China Grill,"Hi, sorry for the unpleasant experience you had at our restaurant, we did some improvement recently, all kitchen staff got tested and all servers must follow the standards. Thanks for your feedback."
Green China Grill,"Green China Grill's (老地方) specialized hand-pulled noodles is where the noodle party is at on Convoy. Per recommendation of my colleague who couldn't stop raving about their Vegetable Stir Fry Noodle (蛋炒麵), we were excited to experience their deliciously handmade noodles.With a limited selection of noodles, skewers and cold dishes, it is a no-brainer of what items to order from the menu. For our first trip, my fiance and I had:- Vegetable Stir Fry Noodle- Braised Beef Noodle Soup - Chicken SkewersBoth noodle dishes we ordered were large in portions and perfectly seasoned. The Vegetable Stir Fry Noodle, being our favorite, was cooked well with a beautiful over-medium soft egg on top really adding a good protein to our diet. One can easily distinguish the difference between hand-pulled vs. machine made noodles, with the hand-pulled noodles tasting fresher, more elastic and better flavor. Which comes at no surprised, since the ladies in the kitchen carefully take note of the ambient room temperature and relative humidity, which affects the gluten and elasticity of the dough. During the kneading, they adjust the texture by adding lightly salted water and/or oil if necessary. So much effort, patience and technique go into these noodles, which makes a big statement of the quality. Because of this, their noodles stand out from other restaurants that buy their noodles in plastic packages. Like in the show Iron Chef where each episode includes a ""secret ingredient,"" Green China Grill's main ingredient is ""cumin,"" well defined in their dishes. With the attentive staff, cleanness, good prices and delicious Vegetable Stir Fry Noodles, we will certainly be coming back for our stir fry noodle fix."
Green China Grill,"This is a quaint, traditional Chinese restaurant but without all the tacky decor of 20 year old Chinese restaurants.Bright green decor with butterflies pasted to the walls, it was an attempt at a green earthy feel. And traditional Chinese music playing in the background. I would've thought it to be Taiwanese styled but it's more Mainland interior cuisine.All the noodles are hand made and there is a a lady in a glass booth you can watch making noodles. The broth has an earthy home style feel. Warm and tasty. So their signature noodle dishes are what you should try, particularly the spinach infused noodles, you can't taste the spinach at all which is great to get kids used to eating their greens.Their best dish for my palette is the Beef cumin fried noodles, just very tasty. A tad oily and can be a little spicy but that makes it taste all that much better The staff is nice but by American standards very shy. The only reason they don't get 5 stars from me, is that the menu is limited and a few interesting items are no longer on the menu  Price is very affordable at $35-40 for a family of 4, even cheaper if you share the large bowls of noodles. We always have left overs."
Green China Grill,"Thank you Daniel, we have updated our menu recently and added some new items like beef hot pot，lamb hot pot, vegetarian hot pot, and seafood hot pot to our menu, we welcome you back to our restaurant again!"
Green China Grill,"A new Chinese restaurant in convoy that has some of the best hand-pulled noodles I've had so far! My friend and I came on a Sunday night and we were immediately seated.At first when walking in, I was skeptical of the lime green walls and chairs. However, once seeing the menu and the food, I really enjoyed my experience at the restaurant. The interior is very new and clean, and you can see the chef pulling noodles in the back. I ordered the green spinach noodle soup with beef and I really enjoyed the flavor of the broth! It was super rich in a meaty flavor and the noodles were super chewy. The spinach noodles also looked very appealing! I also ordered the beef skewers and they had a great, smokey aroma with a lot of spices. I enjoyed the beef pancake the most; it had a soft, flakey skin and slow cooked meat. Overall a great addition to the Chinese food scene in San Diego! Definitely check it out if you're craving a warm bowl of soup and noodles."
Green China Grill,"I came in here without any previous impressions having done no research beforehand. Those are probably the best experiences because the beau and I were able to freely judge the food without receiving any outside opinion from Yelp. Afterward, I was surprised by the rating on here because we seemed to have experienced the A-team on the random Monday night we went. When the beau and I walked in here, someone immediately noticed us and we were seated right away. We didn't have to look over the menu for too long as there wasn't too much available. We had two groups of options: skewers or noodles (only two of which were soup). We opted for the grilled lamb skewers, grilled chicken kebabs, and noodles with braised beef brisket. Their menu contained pictures of all their dinner entrees so ordering was easy. The label tape with the English names for the dishes was a bit ghetto though and there was some inconsistencies between individual menu's on the proper translations for words. It took us some time to grasp that mutton was also lamb in layman terms. Needless to say, our food was delicious!-Grilled Lamb Skewers - Any gamy flavor and smell was masked by the spicyness, but the meat was super tender and juicy. I was dying from the heat, but the beau was OK with it. Still excellent!-Grilled Chicken Kebabs - Very tender, juicy, and seasoned well. I believe it was seasoned with cumin which was definitely a prominent flavor. Easily very enjoyable. -Braised Beef Brisket soup - the largest and featured item on the small menu. Broth was tasty and not overly oily. But the noodles! You'll notice they want to make a big deal out of their noodles since they provide complete transparency into the noodle making process. We watched the lady prepping our noodles through the glass observation window before our bowl was brought to our table. Since their noodles are freshly prepared before being served, it does take a little longer for the food to arrive, but when it does... you'll be in heaven! Noodles were doughy and not necessarily tasteless. The soup, beef, and other ingredients definitely complement the noodles well. Plus, the bowl is huge and they don't skimp on the noodles, so portions for the price are spot on. Definitely the dish that stood out the most! But makes sense.Service was on par; our drinks were filled and the waitress made her rounds although it was hard to get her attention for the check. As a note, parking wasn't too terrible on a Monday night, but other nights on Convoy are worse, but expected. Just watch out for idiots.I leave this restaurant with a four because while their food was enjoyable, I echo the same sentiments of others regarding their limited menu. The small menu made ordering simple, but I hope they expand upon it to keep customers interested. I'll certainly be on the lookout for any additions especially for the soups and skewers."
Green China Grill,"First of all this place has the best service among almost all Chinese restaurants in the convoy area. They (most of the waiters/waitresses)  take your orders with smile and make small communications when serving the food (eg, tell you the name of the dish, remind you of hot plates) and greet you when you leave, which are all pretty standard service you would expect to receive at a restaurant but is surprisingly not seen at quite a few of Chinese restaurants (like China Max in the same plaza or Szechuan Chef in a plaza across Balboa). I would usually go back to a restaurant just because of the service. Plus the food here is quite good too. Especially like their cold dish cucumber and shredded potato, and the noodles taste good too. Although it would be better if they could add more vegetable to the noodle soup. The price is ok although a little more expensive than some ramen place like Nishiki. Here an order of noodle soup is ~$11-12, while at Nishiki a ramen order is typically below 10."
Green China Grill,"So the food here is delicious but I had a very strange experience where we nearly forgot to leave a tip and one of the workers very loudly and very aggressively asked us if we would leave a tip. She quite literally blocked our exit and spoke loudly enough to have the entire restaurant turn to look at us.I know tips are super important and I ALWAYS tip 20%, plus our server was very nice (YES THE WOMAN WHO BODYBLOCKED OUR EXIT WASN'T EVEN OUR SERVER) so that was a wild rude experience. I'm fine with her asking for a tip, but she had done it so unprofessionally, I was winded.100% if she had been our server, that exchange would've had me giving her ZERO tip for the first time in my life."
Green China Grill,The Lanzhou noodles and appetizers were surprisingly tasty as I didn't have high expectations going in. Service was a tad bit slow but I would go again to try other items off their menu. We wanted to leave as we saw a line forming outside the restaurant but it took them a good 10 minutes before they gave me back my credit card copy to sign after I handed them my card. The noodles were nice and chewy but the handmade spinach noodle did not have much spinach flavor which was a little disappointing.
Green China Grill,"Some friend's invited me to come try this place. 1st of all...parking is tight. Had to park off the street and hoof it over. As you walk in, you already get a whiff of several spices in the room. We ordered a few skewers of chicken, beef and shrimp. All very tasty and spiced just right. I have a palette for spicy food. Wished it was a bit more spicy. Ordered the braised beef noodle soup and it was very delicious. It had a numbing feel to it. Seriously! Overall, a great place for fresh noodles. They make it right there and u can watch! Thumbs up for sure!"
Green China Grill,Their menu is very small! Mainly skewers and only a handful of noodles dishes. So keep that in mind if you come here!I  got their braised beef noodle soup which was quite tasty. I came here with two friends and we got the braised beef noodle soup and a vegetable stir fry noodle.We came on a Wednesday night and for dinner the place was full. The staff here only really speak Chinese and not much English so almost all of the diners here were also Chinese. Thank goodness their menu had photos!My noodle soup which is their main selling item was pretty good! I liked that the noodle was hand pulled and for $8.99 the bowl was very big. The stir fried vegetable noodles had no meat and was also $8.99 and it wasn't great but just ok. For the noodle soup I would give a 4 stars but the overall experience was a 3 star.The wait time for everything was long and service was definitely not on point. We waited a long time for our check so I got up to ask for our check and it still never came. So my table mates and I just got up and paid at the cash register. Also the noodle was pretty good but the menu is  very limited and the other items didn't seem to wow us. Overall this place was ok :)
Green China Grill,"My favorite lamb skewers ever in San Diego. But I refuse to buy them because they are priced at $7+ For TINY skewers. If you want to get full off of those, you'll need to win a small lottery. Beef noodle soup: hit or miss. But miss most of the time. The broth color isn't right and tastes like it's diluted. I like my broth hearty so I did not enjoy this dish at all. They've gotten more popular, and they've increased their prices. But it's not worth it anymore and I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon."
Green China Grill,"We loved this place! The food is delicious, fresh and prepared with a lot of care. They have an open and very clean kitchen, and you can see a women making fresh noodles, really cool!I had the meat and sour cabbage noodle soup, delicious! We also had the cold chicken with cumin, it reminded me of wings, but much more flavorful and is not fried.A plus, their bathrooms were super clean and spotless. Friendly and very helpful staff."
Green China Grill,"Restaurant has a lot of potentials, but there are some areas to improve on. First of all a lot of items on their menus are only available for dinner. I think they should post some clear menu outside or something. They posted really nice looking food pictures outside but they do no match with what they have. I didn't like seating down and finding out there are only two noodle choices avail able to order.Their beef noodle soup is superb. Although I do find the content and quality varies per visit. Sometimes it's more spicier, more noodles, or varies between meat and tendons. I hope they settle down on a good standard soonThe lotus root in their cold dish selection is what kept me wanting to come back. It's the most delicious cold dish ever. But on my last visit it become really spicy and I was disappointedGreat service and clean environment. But they need to offer more"
Green China Grill,"I order Xinjiang Spicy Chicken Noodle last night. The noodle is great and chewy, the dish also tastes delicious. I also ordered Sliced Mantou, (should be this name haha) I haven't eaten steamed bun for a long time, I love it!BUT! It's very difficult to park here, this plaza is very busy."
Green China Grill,"Thank you, Cynthia, we have updated our menu, wish you can come and try again."
Green China Grill,"I'd have to come back again for the beef noodles, since I didn't get to eat the beef and only had their seafood stir fried noodles, which was just mediocre and a bit too oily. The noodles, though, was al dente, which was at least appreciated.Coming for lunch was not a good idea. They have minimal selections on their menu, which is mostly for dinner only."
Green China Grill,"The idea of a noodle place with simple menu sounds like a good idea. But there are a few things in my opinion that the place needs to improve on. The first is in the soup. Soup is salty and possibly contain msg as my mouth numbs after two spoon of soup. The second is in the appearence. The bowl is a bit too big for the amount of content. Aside from noodle, meat and soup there was three slices of squash and green onion for garnish. Third is in the noodle. Noodle looks machine made but I am ok with that. It does bother me a bit that the noodles were the same in soup or fried noodle dish.Some positives, staff is friendly and responsive. Atmosphere is overall positive with clean floors and new utensils. Beef in the beef noodle was excellent."
Green China Grill,Tried their new dish called 黄焖鸡. Very disgusting！It tastes like tofu texture，not chicken. And I don't know if they fried the chicken because they meat is not fresh. Very awful texture.Chicken is very easy to cook to be delicious. I don't think the restarant can put this quality dish on their menu to sell for $$$won't come back again
Green China Grill,"The service was pretty bad. Half time eating, the other half waiting:       We sat down for 5 mins and then menus and tea were dropped off at our desk. We didn't order at the first time the Waitress asked, so we had to wait for another 10 mins to order. Nobody checked on us during the 10 mins wait, our meal, or after the meals. The menu is limited and the food is average:I tried the beef noodle soup and the veggies chow mein with fried egg. Both were freshly cooked.It's a family friendly restaurant with great eating atmosphere. A lot of parents bring their kids (under 10 yr old). There's a chef making fresh lanzhou noodles in the kitchen/behind the window."
Green China Grill,"Amazing. That's all you need to know, but I'll tell you more. The cold bar is filled with delicious delicacies from pickled seaweed to pickled tripe (it's all delicious)We had the beef noodle soup with the beef brisket, and I could not eat it fast enough. So good. The handmade noodles were amazing and the broth/meat were enough to fill me up without the noodles, let alone how delicious they were."
Green China Grill,"This place has the most authentic Shanxi style cuisine around the area. The special feature here is the see-though kitchen which you can see noodles are hand-pulled by a chef right in front of you. Personally, the Noodles and Grills here are better than Shanxi Magic Kitchen.My recommendations:1. Beef & Sour Cabbage Noodle Soup2. Spicy Hot Oil Sliced Noodle3. Sour Cabbage Beef Pancake4. Grilled Lamb 5. Grilled Sliced MantouThe only downside here is there is no selections of dishes, such as veggies, fried courses. This place is all about noodles, grills, and dumplings. And for many Chinese people, it's a place for a quick meal, not a dining place."
Green China Grill,"Definitely not a traditional Chinese restaurant, some very interesting soups with homemade noodles. They Also have skewers, buns, and some Fried rice and noodle dishes among other things. The beef soup was very tasty and was very reminiscent of Vietnamese pho, but without as many of the vegetables and sprouts, etc., but very tasty.  The Homemade noodles have a very nice texture And flavor.     All in all it was a great first experience here with some very fun dishes that were quite enjoyable."
Green China Grill,Thank you! Our all noodles are all freshly hand made and all species imported from China!
Green China Grill,"It was very good. The noodles are made fresh, right on site, and the service was quick too. Large portions and we had to go are some home."
Green China Grill,"This is some of the worst food I have ever eaten. I wish I could give it zero stars. I came here right after they had opened their business a few years ago and remember liking their beef noodle soup a lot, so I finally came back again. What a big mistake. Ordered the ""Cumin Beef Fried Noodles"" and ""Beef Sirloin Noodle Soup"". The noodle soup came out first. I couldn't believe my eyes...only 4 really thin, small pieces of beef. Can anyone say stingy? Tasted the broth and thought ""thank god, at least the broth isn't terrible"". But when I started eating the tiny portion of ""hand made"" (hard to believe) noodles, I realized that this isn't the same soup I ate almost 3 years ago. You can buy better noodles in a plastic package at the Chinese grocery store. No taste, lukewarm (like the soup itself) and a rubbery texture. I was hoping the ""Cumin Beef Fried Noodles"" would save the day...but no. I honestly don't know which was worse, this dish or the beef noodle soup. This tiny dish (think half of a ""normal"" Chinese food portion, which is usually quite generous) came out lukewarm, like it was just taken out of a microwave and let sit there for 5 minutes before being served. They were stingy on the beef *again*...only maybe 7-10 tiny pieces which tasted like cardboard, very small portion of noodles, mostly cabbage. The entire dish was drenched in oil. The noodles tasted and felt like rubber. Like I am chewing on badly cooked calamari that has turned into rubber. And the taste? Worse than panda express. No flavor, cold beef. No wonder I barely ever see anyone in this place, while nearby restaurants have lines in front of them. Now I know why. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all cost. You pay $11 each for dishes that suck and portion sizes that should cost $6-7 each at most."
Green China Grill,"Hi, we are so sorry for that unpleasant experience, we have made some changes to our menu and dishes. wish you can come and try again!"
Green China Grill,"I had a good experience here at Green China Grill. Their menu is small but we enjoyed the three dishes that we ordered. I highly recommend trying their sliced noodle soups. We ordered the signature one with the slices of beef. Sliced noodles are my favorite because they're always homemade and I love the texture of those noodles :). We also ordered the beef pancakes. Loved that dish! I'm not a fan of sour cabbage so I ordered the one without. We also got a beef skewer that was tasty. Just a warning though, it's spicy!"
Green China Grill,Love this place. Especially their spicy sauce. Very clean place and also good taste. Is very good place for friend to hang out.
Green China Grill,Thank you Fangting!
Green China Grill,"The food was top-notch, with none of the usual accompanying atmosphere of a nearby pretentious restaurant (I'm looking at you, China Max).  It was a refreshing change of pace, for us to try new food with a reasonable price."
Green China Grill,"Thank you, Richard!"
Green China Grill,Well let me start of by saying this was my second time here and I would say it was not that busy . It took awhile for me to find parking even though it was a Monday . Of Course it's Convoy St . Allways hard to find parking !! Pretty much full all the time . This Restaurant is located near China Maxx Restaurant !! And the Parking can get Full pretty Quick . Well we finally found a Spot and Parked . So we head in and get seated . Now we place our order . And what can I say !! We ordered the Xinjiang Spicy Chicken Noodles !! Boy oh Boy !! The Plate was Huge !! It can feed the Entire Family !! Good Portions !! Next we order the four piece chicken skewers !! Boy oh boy it was on point !!! So Good !! Yum Yum !! It was perfectly Seasoned !! Last we ordered the Beef Lamb Soup this was ok but there is much better Beef lamb soup at other places . This one tasted ok not to much flavor and small bits of Noodles in soup with skinny noodles mix in . The service was ok and I would say good food but of course parking is Allways a problem . So just hang tight and a space will open . Overall I shall return and enjoy again .
Green China Grill,Love this place. Freshly made noodles were so good. Chicken skews were also tasty and full of flavors. Clean and simple decor.  I strongly recommend this place.
Green China Grill,Very nice picture! Thank you!
Green China Grill,"Very friendly and informative staff.  They only had the beef noodle soup and the clear noodle soup. Clear soup was very tasty, wished they put more then one slice of Daikon in it though :-(.  The beef noodle soup did not have as much spices as the clear soup, but was still delicious.They have improved since grand opening back in Dec. 2015!  Still love their spinach green Noodle and the spicy beef Noodle soup.  Will add pan fried Chinese bread and lamb skewers as our regular"
Green China Grill,"My parents and I were starving.  Everywhere we went, there were long lines waiting so we decided to try this place out. From the outside look, the place was busy but clean.We ordered cold dishes for appetizer including ox tripe, seaweed and cucumber. We also ordered noodle with beef, spinach noodle and chicken skewers. The food came in big portion. The hand pulled noodle was made right in front of you. The noodle itself was good, soft but not mushy. I actually like the spinach noodle. I have to give this place a 2/5 because everything was full with MSG, especially the cold dishes and the broth. I haven't had any food with so much MSG that my mouth and throat felt nasty afterward. Friendly and quick service but the MSG killed it! Bottomline, I don't recommend this place and wouldn't come back!"

Green China Grill,"Absolutely adore the food at GCG. They serve the most comforting and delicious hand-pulled noodles in San Diego. When we don't know where to eat, Green China Grill is always a go-to.Food: 5. I get their beef noodle soup with sour vegetables, the cold dishes (ESP the spicy thinly sliced potatoes), and the skewers. Everything is always so tasty and consistent. Their spicy sauce that's on each table is deadly, so beware.Service: 3.5. Service is quick and nice, just about what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. There is almost always no wait for a seat, too, which is always a plus.Atmosphere: 4. They have cute green walls and furniture. It would be nice if they had AC, but it's not really uncomfortably hot when I go, so no biggie."
Green China Grill,There is nowhere else in SD to get Lanzhou La Mian (it's like ramen). This place is SUPER authentic! I love the broth and the fact they handmade the noodles. Portion size is also very generous. Get the original noodles the beef noodle is also good though. Another added bonus is there is chinese style BBQ skewers it's a little pricey but good to know it is available when you really crave it.
Green China Grill,"Thank you Cici, we have updated our menu and added some hot pot, welcome you come again!"
Green China Grill,"Their side dishes, sour cabbage beef wrap, and hot oil hand-pulled noodles are the best. The hot oil hand-pulled noodles are thicker and chewier compared to the ones in the beef noodle soup!"
Green China Grill,"Thank you, Elli!"
Green China Grill,"If you are craving al dente, handmade, freshly made noodles, this is a great spot! Definitely try both the hand pulled and the knife cut noodles. Besides the amazing noodles, the soup flavors are nothing to write home about. The sautéed knife cut noodles do have great flavor though! We also enjoy the small side dishes-the bamboo, wood ear (spicy!) and seaweed. Another plus is that there is usually no wait and it is clean/family friendly."
Green China Grill,"The braised beef noodle soup here is a must. By itself, and adding chili sauce is also a great way to eat it (if you don't mind the spice). For beef noodle soup, which is a standard traditional dish, this is my favorite place in the area. The lamb skewers are good, too.  If you're planning on coming, just be aware of the inconsistent hours. They're closed on Tuesdays and the hours on Yelp and Google aren't the same."
Green China Grill,"Hi, we have renewed our menu hours recently! Sorry for the inconvenience, the Google menu hour is all correct now!"
Green China Grill,This is a pretty easy review.   If you like noodles this place is phenomenal. I ordered the beef brisket hand pulled noodles. The quality of the brisket was just OK. The portion of the brisket was meager. The restaurant is clean and the service was good. If they could bump up their meat quality and quantity this place would be ideal.
Green China Grill,"Hi, we are always improving, wish you can come again!"
Green China Grill,"Sorry, I wanted to like this more b/c the noodles are supposed to be homemade, hand cut, and I couldn't tell.  That's what I ordered with the beef in soup, but I wasn't impressed.  Even worse my friend ordered the garlic noodles that were not handmade/handpulled and they were much better!  (Her noodles came with shrimp)."
Green China Grill,I love hand-pull noodles from the northwestern of China!!! Growing up I had a lot... so I am very happy there is such a place for me to get them in SD!
Green China Grill,"I was really happy to eat. After I saw the face, I felt what it was like to lie. The amount of braised beef noodles and the gap in the photo were great, and there was no taste at all. It was not authentic at all, and there was a big splash. After seeing it, it was speechless and even one-third of it was not there. We didn't have enough of it. It's enough to buy it once."
Green China Grill,"Green China Grill produces fairly authentic ""Lanzhou"" noodles. Note that this doesn't mean their noodles are amazing, but that's generally true of eating noodles in China as well. They do the job, and they do it pretty well. And thankfully, and most importantly, they do it for a decent price. Because the name of the game when it comes to authentic noodles is cheap.I ordered the sirloin beef noodles soup (which, as other reviewers have noted, may be the only variety of beef despite what the menu says), and it was everything I was expecting. Nothing more, and nothing less. It even had that MSG tingle, which people need to understand is part of the authentic experience. (Sucks to all the MSG haters out there!)The beef skewers are more immediately notable and complement well what would be a traditionally drunken meal in China, namely, something that fills you up without breaking the bank.Summary: Decent noodles for not that much green."
Green China Grill,"Clean, cozy dining environment. Food is very authentic, especially the beef noodle soup and lamb skewers. Highly recommended to anyone who's looking to try authentic Chinese noodle soup."
Green China Grill,"Behold!...Noodle heaven. Spicy, beefy, spinachy, cut-with-scissors-or-you'll-get-bathed-in-juice NOOOOOOODDDDLLLLLEEESZZSSSS!We were the only Americans in the place. Great viewing room of the important noodle-making action. A very intimate experience!Restaurant decorated like the inside of a delightful melon. A ripe one."
Green China Grill,"This is one of my favorite places to get beef noodle soup in San Diego. The portion is large and it tastes delicious. The side dishes are also amazing. It reminds me of the food I have in Asia. It can be busy in the weekends at prime dinner time, so you don't want to wait you will have to come a bit earlier or later than usual dinner time. The only downside is parking in this plaza is always a nightmare."
Green China Grill,"They have a rather small menu, so you don't have too many choices.  I loved the texture of their handmade noodles and you can watch them being made from a little window inside. My friends and I tried the vegetable noodles (which said fried rice in the description but were clearly noodles from the pictures), the green soup noodle and the beef noodle soup.The broth for the soup noodles were just ok ... a bit too much MSG for my taste.  There's also cold dishes you can get from the counter. I personally loved the tofu noodles- flavor was awesome! Overall, its just ok here ... not bad, not great.  The only thing I really loved were the tofu noodles but that's probably not enough for me to come back."
Green China Grill,"Dude, this place is legit. Great flavors, good amounts of heat, $4 beers, and super fresh noodles. The only gripe I've got is the service is a little slow, but maybe I just need to be more aggressive in this part of town so I won't hold it against them. I don't quite remember the names of the dishes we had, but we started with a trip of spicy, cold snacks, including tofu & mushrooms. Good textures, quite spicy! Then we the got spicy cut noodles & the sirloin soup. If i was just getting the soup on it's own, i would have been a little disappointed, flavor-wise, but it was a great way to cut the very strong flavors and spiciness from our other dishes, which were all very POW!"
Green China Grill,"excellent hand pulled noodles, will be coming here over and over again, I can't get enough of the beef scallion pancake and the pocket meat sandwich too. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT."
Green China Grill,"This place is garishly green, but I suppose if you're just going for food and not atmosphere it would be fine. They keep a very clean kitchen and it's fascinating to watch them pull the noodles. I wouldn't recommend getting the small dishes as they're all around mediocre and the ma-la numbing sensation really detracts from the taste of the noodles. Speaking of which, they're amazing. This place does one thing right, and that's the knife cut noodles. Tender and just the right amount of chewy, they're the best I've tasted and I've traveled a lot of SE Asia. The green noodles are a bit too soft for my taste but they're decent.I wish they had more options on the menu. Every single page had something that was out of stock, like the liangpi noodles that looked amazing. There's a lot of room for improvement, but if you're looking for a place to get bomb ass hand cut noodles, you're in the right place."
Green China Grill,I would definitely give no star. The worst dishes I have ever had in US! The price is way too more expensive. I ordered beef noodles with soup and fried beef noodle. There are only 4 pieces of beef which is small and thin. The fried beef noodles tasted like rubber. And it is very oily and there is only salty taste! I had the same kind of noodles in China. That was much better. This was not authentic at all. The portions were too small to make me full. I am a tiny girl! It is very disappointing! A total waste of time and money.
Green China Grill,"Hi, Lydia, we have updated our menu and did some new improvement, we have some new items, wish you can come and try!"
Green China Grill,"Came here for lunch with a few coworkers on a Monday. Not too many people so we were able to be seated pretty easily. I ordered the popular beef noodle soup and I was not disappointed! I added a couple of spoonfuls of chili oil to mine since I love spicy, and the flavors were very rich and hearty. Perfect for a cold day or a gloomy one. We also were able to pick a few side dishes for the table, and the one that stood out the most was a pickled tofu skin dish. The only reason I put 4 instead of 5 stars is for the service. The place was less than half full and it still took awhile to get our drinks and the check."
Green China Grill,"Walked in servers didn't greet us. Then they started talking shit in Chinese because I was asking them questions ""like what is in that dish?"" Like I'm suppose to know. After that they took 30mins to make me 4beef skewers which I got it to go so they put it in a box with no skewers the dish portion looked like they only gave me 2 but since they chopped it up you can't tell but wow that wasnt $8 worth of food. Plus the meat was overcooked extra seasoning on it so super salty. Then to top it off my friend who bought the noodle dish asked for a plastic fork to go and he said ""we don't usually give out Plastic forks but I guess this time I will."" Like really??? What am I suppose to do eat it with my hand? Cheap bastards."
Green China Grill,True Lanzhou flavor! The Qingtang one is the authentic one. And have the choice of different noodles
Green China Grill,Yes.  Their soup broth is the cure to the common cold.  I wish this place was open 7 days a week because every time I have a craving it seems to be Tuesday.
Green China Grill,I ordered the brisket flat noodle soup and the egg noodle brisket soup with sirloin. There was very little meat but the noodles were delicious. I also ordered chicken and shrimp skewers. They were absolutely delicious and perfectly grilled. I was like only disappointed with the serving size of the meat in the soup for something priced at $10.99 for a  bowl of noodles... honestly how much do noodles cost? Not much that much but like most businesses making a profit is important to sustain the place. I still recommend this noodle joint. You only get 2 to 4 pieces of beef.
Green China Grill,"The soup noodle is a little bit salty, but till very tasty. The fry noodle is delicious. You can see the chef making the noodle through the window. The environment is bright and clean. Price is ok."
Green China Grill,'spoke marie phone nice patient walked number questions regarding dyi flower arrangements feel rushed able make understand number things seasonal flowers logistics specific flowers communicating marie via email details order next month im excited'
Green China Grill,"Thank you, Jared!"
Green China Grill,It's soooo yummy! I got the veggie and eggs noodles and wow I'm so excited to go back for more
Green China Grill,"The real things are so different from pictures! Although the beef noodle soup is excellent, other dishes are quite limited in portion (surprisingly small portions). I only recommend the beef noodle soup."
Green China Grill,"5 stars for delicious lamb skewers! Walked in the restaurant not knowing what to expect but immediately smelled the scent of spicy cumin lamb and knew I had to have it (even without seeing a menu).  Handmade noodles are very good also. On a recent visit a friend ordered the squid and it was overcooked. I would skip it. Regardless, happy to discover this hidden gem and will be back quite often."
Green China Grill,"Come prepared to EAT as the portions here are HUGE! Green China Grill specializes in hand pulled noodle soups, and for that, they did not disappoint. I got the pickled vegetable with beef pulled noodles and I really enjoyed it! Though if you've never had the pickled vegetables you might want to stick with the original first which is equally as tasty. If you've ever been to a Chinese banquet dinner and been served soup, you're basically getting a family sized bowl for yourself when you come for noodles, it's a lot of food but you won't regret it."
Green China Grill,"Excellent restaurant with authentic hand pull noodles!  Texture is great and you can watch them make it.  The decor is a little antiseptic, but the food is great!  We had the soup noodles which are a little thinner.  The broth is light and could use more flavor and the meat isn't as tender as it could be but it was still very good and the servings are large.  The fried noodles were even better.  This appears to be the only hand pull noodles place in San Diego.    This is the perfect place for birthdays because the noodles are like 3 feet long which according to Chinese custom is good for long life."
Green China Grill,"Great food and generous portions. The ""small size"" of their noodles seems relatively expensive for $16 on paper, but its actually huge and more than enough for 1 person. I can never finish it.  Food tastes great and the hand-pulled noodles are always fresh."
Green China Grill,Thank you!
Green China Grill,"I stopped here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The restaurant was pretty full. I was seated quickly. Once the waitress took my order, she informed me that only the sirloin soup and the vegetable noodles were available to order. The restaurant had been open for a couple hours already, but she explained that the other items are dinner items, which it doesn't say on the menu. I ordered the beef soup, it arrived quickly. I found the fresh noodles to be gummy, a lot of chewing. I also noticed other tables eating items that were supposed to be ""dinner"" items. I was confused, bit the waiter said she didn't speak English and couldn't answer my question on why the other diners were able to order the other items. The broth was delicious though!It took a while to get my check after asking for it 3 times I finally got up and paid at the register. I wouldn't come back again, until they figure out there lunch service problems."
Green China Grill,"I am very picky about Chinese food. The dishes have to taste good and be of good quality. I especially hate short cuts when restaurants use sauces with lots of msg in it. I am allergic and we don't need food to make us sick. So it's hard to find a place that does all that. This place ROCKS!!  Good quality jam hand made noodles, delish broth and I felt good when I left and hours afterwards. You gotta try it. A gem among lots of maybe good tasting, but bad for you restaurants!!"
Green China Grill,"My parents had been raving about this place for a while, so I finally decided to try it with them. We came here at 5:30 PM on a Friday and we were seated immediately. The service was really good, which I definitely appreciated. We got the 3 appetizer plate with tripe, cucumber, and seaweed salad. They were pretty good, but the tripe was a bit too greasy for my liking. Onto the noodles! I got the thick knife cut noodles with stewed beef (can't remember the exact name). The broth was deliciously light and flavorful, and was even better when I added vinegar and hot oil. As for the noodles, they had a nice springy texture, but I wish they were a bit chewier. The meat was alright, nothing special imo. I really enjoyed the few radish pieces that were floating around in the soup too, but there were only like 4 pieces :( Overall, this place is pretty good for a comforting bowl of noodles, but I probably wouldn't choose to come here over other restaurants in Convoy."
Green China Grill,Tasty food awesome customer service!! Love this place! My husband and I come here for their special beef noodle soup and the beef pancake all the time.
Green China Grill,"Thank you Gwen, wish you can come and try again!"
Green China Grill,"I've been coming here since opening week. Why? It's the best noodle shop in San Diego. No pre-packed dehydrated or refrigerated stuff. The noodles are tender and fresh, nothing else like it. I love the broth as well but if you aren't into herbal type of broth, it may not be your favorite. Service has never been bad for me and I can understand when other people ding them during lunch hour. But I feel that  3 stars just because of bad service is a bit harsh. It's the best noodle I've ever had!"
Green China Grill,"Good service,  everyone was very nice,  but everything we ate had only one flavor.  Cumin. The skewers were cumin flavored lamb, the brisket soup was cumin flavored and so were the noodles we ordered.Great if you are obsessed with cumin, but not my favorite."
Green China Grill,"The important point I wanted to get across first is the beef noodle soup is absolutely delicious and the service is friendly; however, I must stress on the fact that the waitresses need to be more efficient and paid more attention on the patrons.Unlike the typical northern Chinese joint where the noodle is pre-packed and frozen, the noodle here is freshly made (like of reminded me of a pizzeria) which is something I appreciate, and ""al dente"" is how I would describe the firmness of the noodle. I don't know about you, but when I head out to eat I am expecting ""taste"" and not ""health"", so the soup and the beef definitely deliver!One note for people who is interested in visiting this new place is the parking sucks, so plan your visit wisely, but it's definitely worth a try in my opinion."
Green China Grill,A good experience. The food was very good and the prices are reasonable. The place is very clean and love the color. The employees are friendly and respectful. Would definitely come back.
Green China Grill,"Decent food, skewers have great tastes & authentic, comparison to power BBQ in Alhambra. However, the selection is limited. Some of the listed on menu often not available. Pro : Nice & clean looking place        Tasty skewer        Decent waiters        Tasty noodle        Tasty cold dishesCons : Saw some cook picked his nose           Some items often not available           A little pricey for Chinese food."
Green China Grill,"Thank you Jazz, we have improved and updated our menu recently, welcome back!"
Green China Grill,"The hand pull noodle especially the green color spinach noodle is one of the best I ever have. The texture is very smooth and taste really good. It is no comparison with other machine made noodle. This restaurant is great on all the noodles only and especially the soup noodles. It tastes better than those in mainland China and Taiwan. The soup base and the beef taste good but there are too few beef pieces. It is nothing compare to the amount of beef on Vietnamese Pho noodle. However, it looks fairly healthy. The other menu items are just OK to good but the selections are few."
Green China Grill,The house noodle and beef fried noodle are my favorite. The restaurant is clean. I will come back.
Green China Grill,"Thank you, we have updated our menu recently, there are more delicacies are waiting for you!"
Green China Grill,"Noodles were chewy and delicious, had hand pulled in braised beef soup and cut noodles in beef cumin sauté. Soup broth was mild and flavorful, beef tender but very small amount compared to pictures.  Bigger cut noodles were chewier than  hand pulled. Added bonus, you can watch noodles being pulled! Will be back for more , want to try the cut noodles in soup next time."
Green China Grill,"Thank you, Meerana!"
Green China Grill,"Their ""cold dish"" (cucumber and seaweed) is very fresh! Usually come here when I lose my appetite or wanna something warm and light. The beef noodle soup is good for my uncomfortable stomach."
Green China Grill,"First timers and honestly, it's great. NEVER JUDGE by the location and the building. Parking sucks but it is what it is. Knowing that the food is close to home is perfect! Decent and reasonable price. Definitely be coming back!! Staff doesn't rush you either!!"
Green China Grill,Food and service were very nice. It was really Chinese food as I was dinning in China. I like it and I will definitely be there again :)
Green China Grill,"NOTHING FANCY, BUT THE FOOD IS GREATIt's just one of many Chinese restaurants buried in strip malls in the Convoy district, but it's well worth the search. Nothing special about the decor, the atmosphere or the service, but the noodle dishes are stars, especially the flat hand-cut noodles in beef broth soups. Ample portions make for a very satisfying lunch. Just be prepared for the food to be on the spicy side."
Green China Grill,"$22 for a bowl of noodles and skewers of lamb later...  Service was good.  Food was meh...   noodle soup was plain with too much MSG.  Lamb Skewers were decent but had pieces of fat in the middle.First of all, most of the really interesting dishes were crossed off the menu with tape.  I hope they can bring those dishes back.  What was left was mainly noodles and skewers.  The noodles themselves were good, especially if they were hand-pulled.  I got there too late to watch them being made.  Good texture and generous portion.  The dish was basically yellow, chicken-flavored broth, the noodles, three slices of meat and two slices of luo-buo radish.  My biggest disappointment, as others have said, was that the base of the soup broth tasted almost entirely of msg.  With its yellowy film it tasted like someone just used packets of ramen soup powder.  The Lamb skewers were small but the flavor was good.  I was surprised to find 3 of 4 skewers had a big pieces of fat hidden in the middle of the skewer.  I accidentally ate the first piece, let it slide, then found two more.  To purposely season a big piece of fat and pass it off on 3 out of 4 skewers as lamb, that's a deduction.  I took a pic of two pieces of fat but thought better of posting it and giving the restaurant a chance to correct this.  You can do better, especially when the total cost with 16% tip (for good service) was $22 for one person.  There are way too many choices of grubbin' Asian food in the area for less money.  Choose wisely."
Green China Grill,"This place was recommended to me by a labmate of mine. Located in the same complex as my favorite AYCE BBQ, but never noticed it before! The place looks relatively new, very clean. I like the bright green chairs they use, really lightens up the room. Directly across from the entrance there's a window where you can see someone pulling the fresh noodles. We came for lunch and it was relatively empty. We were seated right away and the hostess came to explain the menu to us. The lunch menu is pretty limited and definitely not vegetarian friendly; just about all of it is noodles with some kind of meat or skewers. There was a cold counter set up where you could go up and order cold apps, but neither my SO nor I were feeling too hungry, so we just got two noodle bowls - I got the braised beef brisket and he got the ""traditional"" sirloin noodles. For $9 - $10 the portions are ginormous! The meat was tender, the beef wasn't too tough and stringy like it can be sometimes and the noodles are amazing. I'm pretty sad though at the broth. It left my mouth feeling that weird feel I get when there's too much MSG or salt or something, super addictive while I'm drinking it but then super dehydrated and thirsty and kind of off afterwards. There's a $20 minimum for cards which I wish we'd known about beforehand... and the meal was so cheap we were totally under that. For people who were complaining about getting the check, I'm pretty sure they expected people to come up to the register to pay. That's what we saw the two groups before us do and that's what we did too. Can't complain about service in any other aspect. I'm just so bummed about the broth though.. everything else was so on point. Hope they can work on that broth recipe a little more before I try them again.."
Green China Grill,"I had some beef needles with lamb skewers. Food is pretty good, service was decent but if you are planning to eat alone(like I did), and don't have cash, either order $20 worth of food or go get some cash because debt card can be accepted with at least $20 or more."
Green China Grill,Spicy City was closed so we came here. We weren't sure what to expect but the food was reminiscent of Scehzuan food so we were pretty satisfied. The chicken ribs were flavorful and good but a bit difficult to eat and not too much food so it's a perfect appetizer but not for a first date. We also had lamb skewers which were really good and tender. Flavorful as well. The beef noodle soup was really good surprisingly. I have had a lot of bland and uneventful beef noodle soups but this was perfectly subtle and flavored. Really reccomend this place. The only complaint I have is that the staff were a bit aloof. But overall pretty good!
Green China Grill,"Great fresh made hand pulled noodles! Recommend the beef noodle soup, 油泼面, lamb Kebab, side dishes."
Green China Grill,Portions are big and food is fantastic! Atmosphere is a little funky but would definitely come again! Highly recommend!
Green China Grill,"For their grand opening being a week ago and they only had two items on the menu, they were alright. the noodles were freshly made and had a perfect softness."
Green China Grill,"To be honest, kind of disappointed! All food are super super salty. The beef noodle comes with only 5 pieces of thin sliced beef although the hand pulled noodle tastes good. The amont of beef doesn't worth the price of $11.  I don't want to mention the crispy meat."
Green China Grill,"Food here is decent but management is clueless. They have a 20 minimum for cards, and it makes sense, but when a customer is clearly unaware, no exception was made. Good business owners know how to be flexible, and I felt very inconvenienced. To the owner, if you read this: why not have the policy only apply to groups? For someone eating by themselves why should they have to order 20 worth of food?"
Green China Grill,"Went there for the first time today. I didn't even know about this place, I was gonna go eat at spicy city, but saw this new place with full house, so I gave it a try. I love the idea of just having a few items on the menu. Many restaurants have a lot of options on their menu but that usually brings down their food quality. I think they did a really good job perfecting these few dishes. I love love their soup base, not greasy at all, and great texture of homemade noodle! I talked to the owner and he's a very nice man, definitely coming back! :)"
Green China Grill,"They have home made noodles with soup that is very fresh and very testy! The service is good, grill lamb and chicken are good, we are very satisfy !"
Green China Grill,"I grew up in Lanzhou and always tried to find the authentic Lanzhou hand pulled beef noodle soup place and am really glad I found this one. You can see the chef pulling the noodle via the glass in the dinning room. The soup tastes authentic, the noodle also tasted authentic. I wish you get to choose the width of the noodle, if they can do that, it will make this place even better!"
Green China Grill,"This place is amazing! Service is awesome, food comes out fast, most importantly, it has THE MOST authentic cold skinned noodles! Lamb skewers are delicious, beef ramen is good too! Love this place! Wondering how come we didn't find out about it earlier?!"
Green China Grill,handmade noodles and skewers are the best here! the mutton skewers were a little fatty but overall good service and great food
Green China Grill,Good fresh noodles. If you are looking for the beef noodle soup this is not the traditional beef stew you had before. Very little meat. Very thin slices... Staff is slow. The noodle itself is pretty good though.
Green China Grill,"I give one because there is no zero choice. It's the worst service ever! 1st, they missed our dishes, our three toddlers waited more than 30 minutes for nothing!!!2nd, our chao mian is COLD! 3 rd,..."
Green China Grill,"Very disappointed, my first time here was pretty good, but my second try, TERRIBLE. We waited forever for the noodle to come, and everything was sooooo sweet. The beef fried noodle was sweet, wtf, its sweet. 甜死老子了, 酸辣土豆絲拿糖拌的吧, 這牛肉炒麵跟吃lady m似的 蘭州拉麵 the soup noodle is edible, i give a three for that. So if u come here dont order anything but the soup noodle"
Green China Grill,This restaurant servers have very bad attitude to everyone no matter it's customers or delivery company. They are NO RESPECT to other people!! We will never go there again
Green China Grill,Menu is very simple but food is quite pricey. Doesn't take credit card unless you spent more than $20. Will force you to buy more stuff if you don't have enough cash and have to use credit card.
Green China Grill,"This is a great little place and worth checking out if you are in the Convoy area.  There is usually not a very long wait, but that does not mean the food and service is not good.  Great hand pulled noodle dishes.  I love the grilled chicken skewers."
Green China Grill,"I decided to try this place out because they make fresh noodles. I am impressed with the noodles, but that's the only thing that's good. The soup barely has any flavors and the squid kabob was too powdery."
Green China Grill,Very tasty homemade noodles.  Had their signature beef noodle soup (hand pulled) which was very chewy and delicious.  Their cut noodles were very good too.  Everything was very fresh tasting.  One drawback was too much MSG in the broth.  All of us felt it.  I would go back.
Green China Grill,We like this place very much!! The noodles here are genuine genuine genuine northwestern China style !! Beef in the noodles are so tender and tasty!! Broth is also savory . It 's like we were sitting in a restaurant in China again. We will come back pretty soon I think. Hope the food here stays as good as our first visit.
Green China Grill,"Before coming here, I heard lots about their handmade chewy noodle. We order pickle beef noodle, sirloin beef noodle and a 3-item appetizer. I was shocked when our noodle arrived. Only ""2"" paper thin sliced beef in my pickle noodle. My wife's is just a little better than mine, 4 paper thin beef. Its way overprice for such quality. I cannt believe it costed 9.99 each. Both us felt we were robbed.About the appetizer, we had cucumber, black fungus, and seaweed. All 3 items are tasty. Overall, I wont recommand anyone here unless you are interested in only appetizers."
Green China Grill,"At first when I saw the reviews I was wondering why this place had 3 stars, but now I understand. The service is okay. When we went, there are only two waiters for the place and I honestly think there should be one more added. They were doing the best they could and I could tell those two were struggling to keep up with the lunch rush. The kitchen is probably where I think the restaurant has its faults. It's really cool that they have a window for the noodle person to do her thing and have customers look, but that's the only positive thing I can say about it. This is just speculation, but there were a couple of items sent back to the kitchen because of a wrong order, and some items not even sent to the table because they weren't made (one person had food, the other two were waiting for a while as I can see frustration in the father's face). It also took our food a while to come out which doesn't make much sense to me. The noodles should be quick to cook since they are freshly made, and you just add the broth that is already made during prep. It took around 15 minutes for two bowls of noodles to come out. I can only assume that it took that long because there weren't enough noodles made in time. The food was eh. The noodles are pretty good. Nice chew, nice texture and size. The broth for the braised beef noodle soup is too salty in my opinion (and I like salty things). The broth for the beef sirloin noodle soup tasted better in my opinion. The meat was lacking. Too many tendon pieces in replacement of the actual tender beef. The sirloin beef amount is laughable. I honestly think the noodles are the saving grace of this place, but there are a bunch of things that need fixing or else this place is going to end up with no customers. It also helps if you speak Mandarin. Not necessary, just helps."
Green China Grill,I believe they just opened and it shows. A wait with a list but people aren't using it and seating themselves.  It's 6 and only 2 items on the menu available both noodle dishes and kitchen can't even handle it    It's over 30 minutes and other people behind us getting food so they blew that too. Sirloin noodle isn't sirloin  and broth is watery with no flavor and beef tough.   I hope they can get their act together because at this level of service and food they won't last long.
Green China Grill,Handmade noodle is great! The great noodle restaurant! Strongly recommended!
Green China Grill,"When I arrived, the waitress immediately said that all the stuff on the menu was unavailable except for less than 5 items on the back page.She also didn't switch to English after she realized that I couldn't understand her."
Green China Grill,"The restaurant's food is very delicious, particularly authentic, the attitude is also very good. I'll be back soon"
Green China Grill,"We ordered the beef cumin noodles, braised beef noodle soup and a side of corn.   All the food was delicious although if I had to complain about something it would be the small portions of meat in the dishes.  The restaurant itself is very clean and it is very neat how you can actually watch them make the noodles by hand.  My biggest complaint would probably be the very limited menu options, although it is better to make a few things very good than a lot of things poorly."
Green China Grill,"My first impression was similar to Ceci Z.'s. I was confused as to which restaurant I was walking into, because I thought that the menu pictures on the outside depicted what they actually served. However, when I got the menu (the helper just handed me a menu without explaining what was available for what time of day), I was ready to order the schashlik skewers...until my waitress told me that it is a dinner item. Too bad. Ok, so I ordered the vegetable noodle dish. I could not believe I basically only had about 6 choices to choose from! And because I was paying with a debit card, I had to spend at least a hefty $20 for just myself. Geez! I had already ordered the noodles and jasmine tea. Now, I had to order additional items to get my bill up to over $20 buckaroos; like 3 items from the appetizer bar and I threw a beer in there. I just wanted to have a small lunch. The noodles were very tasty and there was more than enough...so I could not stomach all of the tasty appetizers. I have an adventurous tastebud.So, to sum a couple of things up:The pros: the food was good, and I felt that the staff was nervous, but friendly. Also, the design was quite nice and the loo was clean and nicely decorated. I also loved the fact that I had the choice of pouring my beer into a nicely chilled mug, which is not quite common :-). The cons: this is the 21st century. People pay very often with debit cards for items of all kinds for as low as $3.00. Having to spend $20 on very skinny menu items was difficult to achieve without feeling like I was breaking the stomach bank. I'd expect that kind of a price for one person in a nicer-looking restaurant with a somewhat more upscale-ish menu. I'll stick with Dduriba. There, you get more for your money!I'm 37 and appreciate that some people think I look younger than my age.That's nice, really. But 3 minutes after ordering a beer and waiting for my drink to come, the nervous waitress skipped up to me and said, ""Oh, you look....very young! Can I see your I.D.? (nervous laughter)""  Well, that's ok, but 21 is the drinking age in America and no 21 year old...or even a 37 year old normally comes off as very old, don't you think? I didn't say that to her, but hmmm....I'm probably just nitpicking. Anyways, food is good, but I understand that they just started 4 months ago, as I overheard?"
Green China Grill,I love fresh homemade pulled noodles!! What a lucky find. Glad we came. Great service all around. Decent prices and delicious noodle dishes. They just opened a few months back and are working on refining their menu and adding more items. Will definitely be back.
Green China Grill,"We went to Lam Zhou in NYC Chinatown so we thought this is gonna be as good. Nope... Right now, they only serve sirloin noodles and brisket noodles. I agree with the other yelpers saying you can taste the MSG. The broth killed it for me. Service is not super good either. Too bad... My boyfriend and I were excited when we learned about this restaurant."
Green China Grill,"I came here opening day and ordered the noodle soup with braised beef.  Tongue burning salty is how I can describe the dish.  Three weeks later, tried it again, tongue numbingly salty.  Soo much msg.  The cashier asked me the first time, how was it, I told her, very very very salty.  I guess they fixed it to only very very salty. Also, they did not have everything available on their menu.  Common, its 3 weeks in now.  The broth is tasty, but probably very unhealthy with regards to salt/msg levels."
Green China Grill,"Delicious food and simplicity at its best. We always get the beef noodle soup, egg tomato noodle, and the cold dish with potato cucumber and wood ear usually. I cannot emphasize how much we enjoy this place! Thank you for the amazing food."
Green China Grill,"Finally I found LAN ZHOU noodle soup . Their clear noodle soup was really delicious, the taste is just what in my memory . The environment was clean and the decorate is bright and comfort . The bowl is really big , you can share with families. Their grills look so good on the menus , I will come back soon ."
Green China Grill,Grew up in China - the skewers give me nostalgia and are super tasty! Strong cumin taste with some spice. The hand pulled noodles are nice and chewy. It's definitely a step above the norm. There's a window where you can look at the noodles being made :) The broth and meat are good too.Main issue is lack of meat in the noodles - they don't seem to let you pay extra for more meat? They recently increased the amount of meat in each bowl though.

My boyfriend and I were excited when we learned about this restaurant."
Green China Grill,"The important point I wanted to get across first is the beef noodle soup is absolutely delicious and the service is friendly; however, I must stress on the fact that the waitresses need to be more efficient and paid more attention on the patrons.Unlike the typical northern Chinese joint where the noodle is pre-packed and frozen, the noodle here is freshly made (like of reminded me of a pizzeria) which is something I appreciate, and ""al dente"" is how I would describe the firmness of the noodle. I don't know about you, but when I head out to eat I am expecting ""taste"" and not ""health"", so the soup and the beef definitely deliver!One note for people who is interested in visiting this new place is the parking sucks, so plan your visit wisely, but it's definitely worth a try in my opinion."

Green China Grill,Be warned if you are sensitive to MSG. Menu items are limited as of now. Service is good and attentive.
Green China Grill,"Very friendly and informative staff.  They only had the beef noodle soup and the clear noodle soup. Clear soup was very tasty, wished they put more then one slice of Daikon in it though :-(.  The beef noodle soup did not have as much spices as the clear soup, but was still delicious.They have improved since grand opening back in Dec. 2015!  Still love their spinach green Noodle and the spicy beef Noodle soup.  Will add pan fried Chinese bread and lamb skewers as our regular"
Green China Grill,True Lanzhou flavor! The Qingtang one is the authentic one. And have the choice of different noodles
Green China Grill,"The food is okay. A lot of MSG in the food, but still edible. However, I think they require a lot of help with organization/expediting. With the whole restaurant seated, they couldn't put out food. It took almost 1 hour to get all of our food; it took 40 minutes to get the first bowl of soup. We ordered 2 soup noodles and the vegetable fried noodle."
Sizzling Pot King,As an SD native I've had my fair share of rolled tacos but these were amazing. They were so crunchy and the red and green salsas were SO GOOD. Bookmarking this place so I can come back when I'm in the area!
Sizzling Pot King,"These guys deserve so much more love than they are getting...and I'm about to give it!!Las Morelianas is within walking distance of the beach in the LaJolla area.  I know because I just walked it to find lunch one day to bring back to the beach!  It is all uphill from the beach, and perhaps 7/10's of a mile uphill, but well worth the lunch excursion!Simply put, their Asada Fries might be the best I've ever had!  The fact that they get the fries crispy, and to stay crispy for the 20 minute walk back to the beach is incredible!  The steak was just the icing on the fries with It's slightly charred seasoned self!  The tacos were bomb too, however, I'd not recommend the carnitas tacos as they were a little too fatty!If you want the real deal for a taqueria kinda experience, and a great grab n go for the beach, then Las Morelianas is the place!!"
Sizzling Pot King,.love this place!  The ceviche was awesome!  Chips were crispy and thin just the way I like it.  Tasty Salsa were kept cold and covered (self served).  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  Will be back for more items on the menu.
Sizzling Pot King,"I do recommend this place, the food is really good, great customer service the most popular here is the carnitas tacos but we decided to try a salmon plate and we make a great choice this is amazing."
Sizzling Pot King,"Sad to say but food is DREADFUL, terrible, tasteless and salsas are HORRIBLE. Do not eat here please. If you must, BLESS your food but try your best NOT to eat here. Bathroom is disgusting...eating area is filthy. DO NOT EAT HERE!!! Save your health and money."
Sizzling Pot King,"Stopped by this place as we were in the area on a Saturday afternoon. There were no fries and no asada. When we walked in we figured it was seat ourselves since there was no one behind the counter. There were like 2 other tables of people eating already. A big eyebrow girl came out from the kitchen and started eating chips and salsa with what looked like her friend. She said hi to us and said the menus were on the other side of her counter. I got up to get the menus for us. Great first impression on top of them not having several essentials. We grabbed our own drinks from the little side fridge. The food was alright but nothing to write home about. We got carnitas tacos, adobado tacos and carnitas burritos. We used the unisex potty before we left to the nearby beach. The door was broken and offset from the frame so couldn't close it to lock it. Pity we found the one place in La Joya that sucked."
Sizzling Pot King,"I had a good Carnitas Burrito from this Mexican Eatery. It was a rather larger burrito and came with a lot of carnitas and a good amount of fresh guacamole, but I did feel they need work on a few improvements with the carnitas.Like I said, the burrito came generously filled with all the ingredients. The carnitas were tasty and tender, but they needed to be better reheated for the burrito. They were warm to room temp in the burrito. I suggest they put the carnitas in a hot pan or griddle to get them at maximum temp and build up those crispy edges. They should be piping hot in that burrito. The guacamole was good, but could of used some seasoning. The burrito could of used more pico de gallo. It was quite limited in the burrito. The flour tortilla was of very good quality and tasty. I was not a huge fan of the hot sauces. I felt they needed a more developed flavors. The staff was friendly enough."
Sizzling Pot King,This place is located right on the corner of La Jolla Blvd and Pearl.  The line is nowhere near as long as The Taco Stand.The Carnitas Burrito is awesome here. Highly reccomend!!!
Sizzling Pot King,This place is absolutely delicious!! The mixed carnitas is where it's at!! The flavor is authentic and every time I've come here the staff has been absolutely amazing!

Sizzling Pot King,"Food is OK I guess, if you're really really hungry.  This definitely isn't the type of place you'd make your go to spot though.  Houses in this neighborhood sell for north of $10 million so I would hope they have a better taco spot close by.  They were also out of carne asada.  Gotta be tough to run a taco shop when you don't even have the standards.  Probably wouldn't return."
Sizzling Pot King,This place is the bomb! No line and the food came out quick. Satisfied our hunger and provided us with happiness. We had the California burritos and carne asada tacos. The salsa was great! Definitely recommend.
Sizzling Pot King,"The food was absolutely dry, the chicken had no flavor. I order a burrito and it was so hard and cold, as if it had been laying out for a the past day or two. My other 3 friends absolutely also hated what they ordered. No one finished their food. I gave mine to some homeless person. I would NEVER come back, because I had an upset stomach after their food.With that being said, the service was good and the very polite."
Sizzling Pot King,"I came to this recently opened taco shop in the village of La Jolla, where Ohana Cafe used to be, on two separate visits. The first occasion was before the stay in place restrictions were in effect, and the second time was afterward for take-out. They have sister locations in Normal Heights and in the South Bay. As far as I am aware, this is the only spot north of I-8 in central SD that sells Michoacan-style carnitas by the pound ($15.99).That was what I ordered to-go most recently. The price included Mexican rice, pinto beans, ten corn tortillas, cilantro, onions, and salsa. The pound was a mixture of maciza (white meat), cueritos (skin), buche (stomach), and costillas (rib meat). The meat was so moist and well-seasoned. I had to split the portion into two separate servings, but the next day meal was still just as good after I had re-heated the meat.At my initial dine-in, I picked three of the seafood tacos at $3.99 each... gobernador, marlin, and spicy pulpo (octopus). The gobernador was made up of grilled shrimp, melted cheese, tomatoes, peppers, and onions. It was my favorite of the trio, although the marlin was a close second. The size of these tacos was excellent for the price. I rinsed down the tacos with a cup of the pepino flavored agua fresca which was a cucumber limeade.If I am on Pearl St, then I will pick Las Morelianas over the competitors down the block. There are no long lines here with more indoor seating. The menu is much more expansive with equally good if not better pricing for the quantity of food. The carnitas sold by the pound was what led me to give them the extra star in my rating.PS: They also sell chicharrones (crispy, deep-fried pork rinds) by the pound too!"
Sizzling Pot King,I was lost...but found a delightful little Mexican restaurant.  Very authentic in flavors and the service was superb.  Definitely satisfied my fill for Mexican food.
Sizzling Pot King,Wow flavor delicious loved it ...And hubby is picky..Has aloe of flavor and is delicious will come back
Sizzling Pot King,"We ordered Las Morelianas to go for lunch and it was delicious! I ordered the shrimp enchiladas with the green sauce; my husband ordered the rolled tacos; my daughter the breakfast burrito and my son the chicken nuggets with fries. We also ordered churros as well. My shrimp enchiladas were great! The shrimp were so big and juicy! My husband loved the rolled tacos and all of the toppings that came with (normally he's a pretty plain eater, but he dived right into these rolled tacos and was surprised how much he liked it all together. The burrito was huge and we were able to save some for a snack for later."
Sizzling Pot King,This is spot you must come to if your craving a beer n some fresh fish!!I got a huge michelada with a modelo and some fish and shrimp ceviche!Definitely will be here again :)
Sizzling Pot King,"Really solid Mexican food ... Not greasy at all, but still bad enough for you to be delicious :-) I've had their carnitas plate and their chicken rolled tacos, both really tasty though slightly on the dry side. Prices are incredible for what you get - the portions are large and packed with your choice of protein."
Sizzling Pot King,"Fantastic food, service, and seating at this cool spot in La Jolla. There are some really good hipster taco spots nearby, but sometimes you want to enjoy a good meal and NOT have to wait in line for an hour. We tried the fish tacos, octopus tacos, marlin quesadilla, and all the salsas. Top notch service, some really interesting menu items, and COVID-safe seating options. We are going to be back soon!"
Sizzling Pot King,I ordered carnitas burito.Taste - 5 star.Service - 5 star.Red sauce was spoiled but I reported it so they can take it off the shelf and replace with new. The guy apologized. All good.I would have given 5 star if the red sauce wasn't spoiled.
Sizzling Pot King,Tasty tacos. The asada tacos come w/ guac which I was happy about since $3.50 feels expensive for a taco. They also gave me lots of extra limes when I asked. Thank you!
Sizzling Pot King,What a great carnitas burrito.  Stoped here cause we were in La Jolla looking around and this place was not in the crush of people.  What a pleasant surprise.  5 stars all the way.
Sizzling Pot King,If you are coming here thinking you're going to get the same food quality as the location on imperial ave don't even waste your time the food is disgusting I was excited when I drove by to get  some real Mexican food in the area. I ordered the fish soup and while I waited for my food to be ready I can hear a microwave go on in the kitchen it's obvious they microwaved the soup. The container it came in was hot but the fish was cold ... don't come here drive a extra 20 minutes down to imperial ave for some real food. Keep in mind before ordering I asked the kind gentleman in the front if it was the same as the one on imperial he very proudly confirmed it was!
Sizzling Pot King,Omg this place is delicious!! The agua chili is the bomb ! And the carnitas are tasty and delicious... I love it ! Big portions and not That expensive. I would have posted pictures of the big portions but I dug in fast haha!
Sizzling Pot King,Good food. Try the carnitas & ask to add guacamole. Fresh tortillas. Chipotle cream sauce. Tacos all come with hot carrots. Solid prices. No taco stand line. They have outdoor seating. Using a card will cost you .50.
Sizzling Pot King,"So I ordered the breakfast burrito with chorizo, ham, and bacon... unfortunately thats not what I received. My first bite didn't include bacon, ham, or chorizo, instead my taste buds were met with a piece of HOT DOG. I was absolutely repulsed, disgusted to say the least. Did they think I wouldn't notice that the ""ham"" was actually a chopped up hot dog? Or is that their version of ham? I've had MANY breakfast burritos in my day and NEVER have I ever had one with hot dog."
Sizzling Pot King,We gone a beef burrito and there were about 20 pieces of bones cut up inside the burrito.  I almost vomitted.
Sizzling Pot King,Got the Regio Taco and it was delicious! Can't wait to return to try their ceviche. Thank you! Btw the mild salsa was perfect
Sizzling Pot King,"So I consulted with yelp on my first night in La Jolla, walked down to The Taco Stand, saw the line down the block, and immediately turned around and went back to Los Morelianas, where I'd passed by moments before. Glad I made that decision- I had a REALLY delicious Mar y Tierra California burrito. Like INCREDIBLE. Huge shrimp that were super fresh (even at the end of the night). Tender carne asada, and everything was in perfect proportions. Don't pass up this gem!! Also even though I don't eat pork I snapped a pic of their pork ...display... to send to a friend. He confirms it looks amazing."
Sizzling Pot King,Ok first time here. We got a bean & cheese and a chicken burrito. The chicken was good and the salsa orange/red was tasty. The bean& cheese literally tasted like bacon not at all to our liking also found a piece of hot dog in the burrito. I'm not interested in returning. If you're a pork lover this place would be good for you.
Sizzling Pot King,Grabbed a chicken taco here and it was unbeatable I would even go as far to say that it's better than The Taco Stand. It was delicious. Their sauces are so tasty and I will definitely be back. I'm so glad this place is close to me! Thank you!
Sizzling Pot King,"Thank you, we will see you soon"
Sizzling Pot King,Amazing lowkey spot to visit. Their ceviche is so good and aguachiles is wowowwww (but spicy so be warned if you don't like spice). Aguas frescas are made fresh too so that's a plus! Best Mexican food I have seen in this area!
Sizzling Pot King,"Excellent mexican food, generous portions.  I would get the California burrito and switch the carnitas with pulled pork.  Would definitely come here again.  Not sure if its authentic but its definitely good hangover food. Just Re posting this on yelp so I can find it faster later"
Sizzling Pot King,"Came to grab a burrito last week and here again today before I hit the beach. Food is authentic as it comes and great prices all around. Why wait at the taco stand for average Mexican food at best when you can come to this place and grab an awesome carnitas burrito for $5 on a Tuesday. People are super friendly and the place is kept nice and clean. Great carnitas, awesome guacamole, best salsas highly recommend this place! Thank you for the great hospitality"
Sizzling Pot King,"The staff was friendly and green salsa is really good so they go from a 2.5 to a 3.  We called in our order to go yesterday afternoon, a California burrito, a bean and cheese burrito and a carne asada quesadilla. Cali burrito was ok.  The meat has good flavor, but was really salty.  Overall an ok burrito.  The bean and cheese burrito was horrible. The beans were so salty they were inedible. We ended scraping off the beans and just eating the tortilla.  They also use black beans instead of refried pinto beans.  The carne asada quesadilla was ok, but again the meat was super salty.  There wasn't enough cheese so when we picked up a piece the meat would fall out.  They also cooked the guacamole inside the quesadilla which is a little strange.  With a tip ended up spending $25.  We really wanted to like this place, but I probably won't return."
Sizzling Pot King,"Discovered this place based while waiting at a nearby taco shop. We ordered the shrimp burrito and the shrimp ceviche. I can't describe to you how delicious this food was. The burrito contained medium to large shrimp that was absolutely fresh and we modified it by putting cabbage and chipotle sauce in it...muy bueno!Ceviche was made fresh to order. Do yourself a favor and order from this place next time you're in this area, you won't be disappointed!"
Sizzling Pot King,"I know it sounds crazy but with the addition of Las Morelianas, Pearl has become one of the best streets for Mexican food in San Diego.  The carnitas here are really the main attraction, and there are 5+ varieties with different ratios of meat to fat and different flavors. Get the full pound meal, mix and match a few styles, and you'll easily feed two adults for under $20. The tortillas that come with the meal are also freshly made and outstanding. For carne asada or pollo asado I'd stick with Don Carlos up the block, and of course Taco Stand for tacos (call ahead to skip the line), but if you like pork this is the place.[The menu is heavy on seafood and it looks great including fresh oysters, but I'll wait to try those to comment.]"
Sizzling Pot King,"Sooo nasty got sick  come on its carnitas (fried pork) again (fried pork) thats what carnitas means... not boiled pork meat!!!!! Salsas where nasty  ... i end up trashing more than half of food , lots of flies an lazy ass workers dont  care to keep tables or place clean not recomended / lugar sucio no son carnitas es carne de puerko (cocida ) eso no es carnitas... sucio y me hizo daño o"
Sizzling Pot King,I just had the best carnitas tacos I have ever had. I have travelled throughout Mexico and Central America many times. No on has beat this place. A must try guys.
Sizzling Pot King,"so good. adobada burrito with sour cream or mar y tierra fries, extra crispy. Eat here like 2x a week at least and it hits the spot every time."
Sizzling Pot King,We gone a beef burrito and there were about 20 pieces of bones cut up inside the burrito.  I almost vomitted.
Sizzling Pot King,"Best red sauce you've ever had. I order it in the large drinking cups. Chicken burrito is awesome and better than the one at the always packed ""taco shop""."
Sizzling Pot King,Stopped by here last night and the carnitas were DELICIOUS! Not to mention the gentleman behind the counter provided great service. Will be coming back!!
Sizzling Pot King,Good food. Try the carnitas & ask to add guacamole. Fresh tortillas. Chipotle cream sauce. Tacos all come with hot carrots. Solid prices. No taco stand line. They have outdoor seating. Using a card will cost you .50.
Sizzling Pot King,Really fantastic surf and turf burritos!!! Smothered in a gooey cheese sauce and really flavorful steak and shrimp. Wow. Just really impressed.
Sizzling Pot King,"Went to check the line at taco stand and thing was basically to yoga fuzn so i naturally parked at mitches and got depressed for a minute...considered going for a little sirloin wrap and maybe a little baba ganoush over at market place but was really spracked on some al pastor!! Need that spicy pig man gotta have it!! Anyway, flipped a left over that double yellow and charged down to las morelianas to see if the al pastors were breaking down there...dude at the counter said ""no man we dont have Al Pastor""....que the voices...the onslaught of my predicament staring into the deep dark abyss of my soul i told him ""ahhh man im really spracked on that Al Pastor man im on a mission"" to which he replied ""we have the adobada"" i sighed said shit or somethin like that and then he broke into his pitch, assuring me that adobada was the same thing just not cooked on the spike...he sorta hard sold me on it, i felt a little weird but just codependently said ""ill have one of those, an adobada burritto sir, thanks!"" Any way long story short got home to my thrown, un wrapped my non spike cooked pig baby, poured some green sauce on that baby (which already had my attention just based on its looks it was beautiful it was beautiful) and took a bite. SLAPAPP!!! Thing is AMAZING!. Mind blowingly good, totally the same stuff man that spicy pig that spicy pig...gunna go back fur shur, order another with double meat...no ine was there either, just me and my jarritos, no line, nada. Bless their hearts they saved my mission i was victorious."
Sizzling Pot King,"Sadly this was no good at all. Not authentic Mexican food at all. Ordered the carne asada burrito, the menudo, the two asada tacos with rice and beans, also orders the California burrito. The California burrito was the worst. Honestly didn't taste like a California burrito and was very greasy. The menudo was ok. The asada  meat itself was bland and didn't have flavor at all. Price was average but you better off have Mexican food from Tacos gavilan or Albertos Mexican food. This small place was a disappointment especially since I read the reviews before eating here. Just giving honest opinion. I honestly don't recommend you coming here."
Sizzling Pot King,"Happened to be in the area and saw the banner saying $4.99 Tuesday special burritos-carnitas, chicken or fish.  Ordered the carnitas and it tasted great. The tortilla had a bit of a crunch to it as I think it was on the grill.  I loved it.  I would eat here again especially on a Tuesday!"
Sizzling Pot King,This was the worst I've ever had. Carnitas burrito was filled with chunks and chunks of fat and overall left a disgusting taste in my mouth. I took 2 bites and threw the rest away.
Sizzling Pot King,"This place is AMAZING! My favorite is the carnitas tacos. It's unlike any other place in town, you just have to try it.  Also good prices and quick and friendly service. I recommend it to my friends all the time."
Sizzling Pot King,They make the best carnitas I've ever had.  Definitely get the carnitas tacos and a side of chicharrones.  Jim was working the counter when I went there and he was incredibly nice and helpful.  Will come back for more pork!
Sizzling Pot King,Truly best tacos and burritos we've ever had!!!!! Highly recommend the crispy tacos. Great customer service as well!!!
Sizzling Pot King,Great place. Shrimp tacos were bomb. I definitely recommend this place. Couldn't of been more satisfied.
Sizzling Pot King,This was the worst I've ever had. Carnitas burrito was filled with chunks and chunks of fat and overall left a disgusting taste in my mouth. I took 2 bites and threw the rest away.
Sizzling Pot King,Authentic carnitas and great ceviche. This place is best in La Jolla right now! Not your standard taco shop.
Sizzling Pot King,"I love Taco Stand and Don Carlos but if I'm craving a carnitas burrito, this is the La Jolla spot I'm ordering from."
Sizzling Pot King,"AMAZING!! So authentic!! Carnitas plate and aguachiles are amazing, customer service is great, super nice people. Not many authentic, true quality places like this around - let's make it last!!"
Sizzling Pot King,Wow....BEST carnitas rolled tacos.  BEST crunchy tacos.  Will be back!  Plenty of outdoor tables.  Great service.  Get the cucumber lime aqua fresca.  You're welcome.
Sizzling Pot King,"Phenomenal menu.  Must stop, it's ridiculous that so many people overlook this joint.  Just do it"
Sizzling Pot King,"Friendly staff, Covid-friendly, never disappoints! I always rotate between the shrimp burrito, carne asada, and chicken quesadilla. Great variety of salsas, as well!"
Sizzling Pot King,The tacos are delicious! Fav is the gobernador taco. Fresh shrimp. Yummy spicy salsa. Steak taco is fantastic as well. Friendly service!

Sizzling Pot King,Placed a 125$ delivery order in LaJolla and it was picked up and never delivered. Nicholas the cashier tried to help but has no info and no manager on duty. He respectfully asked me to refer to the app I ordered it off of (which was off their website) but there is no number to call. Could only respond to their email confirmation from the original order. I understand that COVID is causing issues but businesses need managers for direction.. !!!!!UPDATE: the app replied and agreed to credit the order!!!!!!!Would not recommend other than Nicholas did the best he could...it seems. 2 1/2 hours later...ended up at  Don Carlos and they rocked it!!
Sizzling Pot King,Stopped by here last night and the carnitas were DELICIOUS! Not to mention the gentleman behind the counter provided great service. Will be coming back!!
Sizzling Pot King,"I've had a carnitas tacos and chicken burritos and it's definitely worth it! With taco stand across the street this is a worthy competitor. The tortillas they base their food off of are all extremely fresh, soft, and flavorful. Very excited to try everything else on the menu!"
Sizzling Pot King,"Best red sauce you've ever had. I order it in the large drinking cups. Chicken burrito is awesome and better than the one at the always packed ""taco shop""."

Sizzling Pot King,"Went in for a takeout order, and the employees were very nice. The food is delicious. I got some fish tacos on corn & flour tortillas and you can tell all of the ingredients are fresh."
Sizzling Pot King,"Not sure what happened.  The food was excellent with high quality flavorful ingredients,  but my last three meals have been At best OK, but very tough essentially inedible care Asada, rubbery uncleared shrimp, and a change in staff attitude from friendly to ""why are you bothering me"".  Not a move in the right direction."
Sizzling Pot King,"Seriously good.  More traditional tasting then most taco places with more complex flavors and good ingredients.  The carnitas, adobada, and spicy shrimp were excellent.  A new favorite."
Sizzling Pot King,"Best Carnitas and Aquachilies in town. Be sure to come here for a great, authentic Mexican food :-)"
Sizzling Pot King,"Opened three days ago... when we walked in the owners greeted us with a sample taco of their delicious super fresh and succulent carnitas.  Amazing.  It was difficult to decide whether to go the meat or seafood route.  My husband had two fish tacos and a shrimp taco.  All of it was delicious.  The  chipotle shrimp taco had a base of melted cheese and chipotle sauce on top.  I had a ceviche tostada with shrimp, mango and avocado.  It was completely fresh tasting with nice shrimp and ripe mango. My first ceviche in over fifteen years since a trip to South America and this one in San Diego didn't disappoint.  Other alluring menu items included a pound of carnitas where you could choose what parts of the animal you wanted, beautiful soups, and pretty much everything everyone else ordered and was enjoying at their tables.  Friendly, clean and really nice owners -- give it a try!"
Sizzling Pot King,"They were about to close, but the cashier let me get one last order in...thank you! I ordered the Marlin taco, the jalapeño shrimp and steak taco, and the gobernador taco. All were really, really delicious, and the hot sauces were a perfect compliment. I grew up in SD, I hope this place stays around for a long time- the tacos rival anywhere else and most places don't have their variety! Looking forward to trying more of the menu..."
Sizzling Pot King,"Got bean and cheese burrito, was bad, canned beans, gross. Fresh juice drink tasted like water. Don't get how this place has 5 stars. They were trying to sell me carnitas, probably because it was about to be bad the next day. Eckkkk"
Sizzling Pot King,Amazing foood! We got three different things off the menu and everything was spectacular.
Sizzling Pot King,"New-opened  at the corner of pearl and La Jolla Blvd. We tried the grill fish burrito and crispy fish burrito last week, and the steak and the carnitas burrito this week. All tastes really good! Not a very long waiting line there. Will definitely try other dishes."
